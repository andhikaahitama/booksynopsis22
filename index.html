This groundbreaking collection of documents, essays, articles, and excerpts from histories, biographies, plays, novels, letters, and the oral histories of key eyewitnesses provides unique perspectives for the historian and student of history all compiled by experts at the Atomic Heritage Foundation. Photographs throughout depict key moments and pivotal figures. <em>The Manhattan Project </em>gives actual voice to a significant period in history. <br><br></p><p>Born out of a small research program that began in 1939, the Manhattan Project brought together the cream of the scientific community and the military to create and perfect a weapon more powerful than any the world had known. Racing against time as the war raged in Europe and Asia, and against our enemies, whom we feared were pursuing similar ends, the Project would eventually employ more than 125,000 people and cost a total of over $2 billion--and the entire operation was conducted under a shroud of secrecy, at remote sites around the country.This groundbreaking book--the first of its kind--collects the writings and thoughts of the original participants in the Manhattan Project, along with pieces by the most important historians and interpreters of the subject. It is a rich and comprehensive compilation of documents, essays, articles, and excerpts from histories, biographies, plays, novels, letters, oral histories, and more, and is the freshest, most multi-faceted exploration yet of the topic. Including material by and about J. Robert Oppenheimer, Leo Szilard, Albert Einstein, Richard Feynman, Leslie Groves, Klaus Fuchs, Henry Stimson, Vannevar Bush, Harry S. Truman, Niels Bohr, and many other key figures, it also collects the writings and testimony of those in the trenches at the Project, their families, and local eyewitnesses. Finally, the book includes thoughts and concerns about the bomb, set down in the aftermath of its deployment, by politicians, writers, artists, and others who saw that the world would never again be the same.Assembled with authority and care by the president of the Atomic HeritageFoundation--in cooperation with a team of advising historians that included the Pulitzer Prize-winning Richard Rhodes--&#34;The Manhattan Project &#34;is an invaluable addition to the historical record as well as a gripping narrative of scientific discovery, military strategy, and moral reflection.<b>Cynthia C. Kelly</b> is the president of the Atomic Heritage Foundation and the author/editor of several books on the subject including <i>Remembering the Manhattan Project</i>.<b>Richard Rhodes</b> is the author of 22 books, including novels and works of history, journalism, and letters. His <i>The Making of the Atomic Bomb </i>won a Pulitzer Prize, a National Book Award, and a National Book Critics Circle Award.</p><h2>Burma Chronicles</h2><p><p><b>A timely and incisive portrait of a country on the tipping point</b></p><p>After developing his acclaimed style of firsthand reporting with his bestselling graphic novels <i>Pyongyang: A Journey in North Korea </i>and <i>Shenzhen: A Travelogue from China</i>, Guy Delisle is back with <i>The Burma Chronicles</i>. In this country notorious for its use of concealment and isolation as social control&#x2015;where scissors-wielding censors monitor the papers, the de facto leader of the opposition has been under decade-long house arrest, insurgent-controlled regions are effectively cut off from the world, and rumor is the most reliable source of current information&#x2015;he turns his gaze to the everyday for a sense of the big picture. </p><p>Delisle's deft and recognizable renderings take note of almsgiving rituals, daylong power outages, and rampant heroin use in outlying regions, in this place where catastrophic mismanagement and ironhanded rule come up against profound resilience of spirit, expatriate life ambles along, and nongovernmental organizations struggle with the risk of co-option by the military junta. <i>The Burma Chronicles </i>is drawn with a minimal line, and interspersed with wordless vignettes and moments of Delisle's distinctive slapstick humor.</p></p><p><p>Born in Quebec City in 1966, <b>GUY DELISLE </b>spent a decade working in animation in Europe and Asia. In 2005&#x2013;2006, he accompanied his wife, an administrator for Doctors Without Borders, on a fourteen-month posting in Burma.</p>DeLisle's (<i>Pyongyang</i>) latest exploration of Asian life is probably the best possible argument against the ruling junta in the embattled (and now nearly obliterated) nation also known as Myanmar. Readers will find themselves initially shocked and surprised at the country's differences, then awestruck by the new traditions and finally in love with and yet enraged by Burmese daily life. DeLisle's wife is a French aid worker with Medecins Sans Fronti�res (Doctors Without Borders), leaving DeLisle alone with their son, Louis, and his cartooning. DeLisle's style is simple but highly eloquent, and he tells more about the depth and breadth of the Burmese experience in the book's little nonfiction vignettes than he ever could in an artificially imposed narrative. <i>Burma Chronicles</i> is not merely a neat piece of cartooning but a valuable artifact of a repressive and highly destructive culture that curtails free speech with unparalleled tenacity. Like Joe Sacco's <i>The Fixer</i> and <i>Safe Area Gorazde</i>, DeLisle uses cartooning to dig into a story that demands to be told. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And Aunts, of course, who might sing a little loudly after dinner. There are the neighborhood cats "sleek and long as jaguars and horrible-whiskered," the carols to sing at eerie houses, the Useful Presents and the Useless Presents, and the endless snow "shawling out of the ground." First published in HARPER'S BAZAAR some fifty years ago, A CHILD'S CHRISTMAS IN WALES showcases Dylan Thomas's genius for language and remains the poet's most popular prose work in the United States. Chris Raschka's fluid torn-paper illustrations honor the poet's words, evoking their musical cadences and bringing us a fresh appreciation for this most lyric work.</p><p>Dylan Thomas is lauded as one of the greatest of the twentieth-century poets. Born in Swansea, Wales, in 1914, he became a journalist at seventeen and published his controversial EIGHTEEN POEMS in 1934, which made him an overnight success. Dylan Thomas was markedly influential in his short life and produced work that remains wildly popular today, including the bitter and poignant "Do not go gentle into that good night" and the strikingly dramatic Under Milk Wood. Dylan Thomas died in 1953. A CHILD'S CHRISTMAS IN WALES remains one of his best known works, and many families count a rousing reading of the poem among their favorite holiday traditions.<br><br>Chris Raschka is the illustrator of many picture books, including the concrete poetry anthology A POKE IN THE I, edited by Paul B. Janeczko, which was named a NEW YORK TIMES Best Illustrated Children's Book. He is also the author-illustrator of the Caldecott Honor Book YO! YES?, and has been hailed by PUBLISHERS WEEKLY as<br>"one of the most original illustrators at work today."Grade 3 Up&#x2013;Raschka's illustrations will surely enhance children's enjoyment of this nostalgic, bittersweet memoir. Executed in ink, torn paper, and gouache on sensuously textured paper, they are full of tiny details that beg for closer inspection. Some libraries may still have copies illustrated by Fritz Eichenberg (New Directions, 1997), Edward Ardizzone (Godine, 1980), or Trina Schart Hyman (Holiday, 1985). Of these earlier editions, Hyman's probably succeeds best at capturing the story's time and place. Raschka, however, finds the universal elements that a contemporary child can relate to&#x2013;the eccentric aunts, the joy of pretending to smoke candy cigarettes, the classification of gifts into "Useful Presents" and "Useless Presents." This is a handsome book that most libraries will want.<i>&#x2013;V. W.</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Felice Benuzzi was a junior officer in the Italian Colonial Service, stationed in Addis Ababa, when the British thwarted Mussolini's ambition to build a colonial empire in East Africa. Benuzzi, along with thousands of other Italians, was captured and interned in a POW camp near the foot of Mount Kenya, where he and his countrymen languished indefinitely, waiting out the war and the desperate boredom, passivity, and isolation of prison life. "In order to break the monotony," he writes, "one had only to start taking risks again." But the isolation of the camp precluded the possibility of escape to a neutral country: "I thought, then at least I shall stage a break in this awful travesty of life. I shall try to get out, climb Mount Kenya and return here." So begins <i>No Picnic on Mount Kenya</i>, a first-class adventure story full of courage, humor, and exquisite detail. <p> Benuzzi and two fellow prisoners spent six months secretly hoarding food; sewing clothing, shoes, and tents; and scavenging for scrap metal to hammer into ice axes and crampons. After escaping, they braved the multiple risks of capture, wild animals (including elephants and rhinoceros), starvation, frigid weather, and some of the most challenging climbing conditions in Africa. The men ascended 16,300 feet to Mount Kenya's Point Lenana, hoisted a homemade flag, and then returned to the misery of the camp. Benuzzi and his comrades never cared that their freedom was fleeting: they climbed Mount Kenya to reaffirm their humanity in the face of a barbaric world war. The gallantry of this gesture sets <i>No Picnic</i> apart from typical mountaineering stories of risk and self reliance. <i>--Svenja Soldovieri</i></p>In 1943, Felice Benuzzi and two Italian compatriots escaped from a British POW camp in equatorial East Africa with only one goal in mind - to climb the dangerous seventeen-thousand-foot Mount Kenya. No Picnic on Mount Kenya is the classic tale of this most bizarre and thrilling adventure, a story that has earned its place as a unique masterpiece of daring and suspense.

Original.</p><p></p><h2>Why Shoot A Butler</h2><p>Amateur sleuth Frank Amberley stumbles upon a bizarre murder case when he finds the butler at Norton Manor dead from a gunshot wound. Reissue.</p><p>Georgette Heyer's novels have charmed and delighted millions of readers for decades. English Heritage has awarded Georgette Heyer one of their prestigious Blue Plaques, designating her Wimbledon home as the residence of an important figure in British history. She was born in Wimbledon in August 1902. She wrote her first novel, The Black Moth, at the age of seventeen to amuse her convalescent brother; it was published in 1921 and became an instant success.<br><br>Heyer published 56 books over the next 53 years, until her death from lung cancer in 1974. Her last book, My Lord John, was published posthumously in 1975. A very private woman, she rarely reached out to the public to discuss her works or personal life. Her work included Regency romances, mysteries and historical fiction. Known as the Queen of Regency romance, Heyer was legendary for her research, historical accuracy and her extraordinary plots and characterizations. She was married to George Ronald Rougier, a barrister, and they had one son, Richard.<p>The signpost was unhelpful. Some faint characters on one of its blistered arms informed the seeker after knowledge that Lumsden lay to the west, reached, presumably, at the end of a dubious-looking lane. The other arm indicated the direction of Pittingly, a place Mr<br> Amberley had never heard of. However, if Lumsden lay to the west, Upper Nettlefold o ught to be found somewhere in the direction of the obscure Pittingly. Mr Amberley<br> switched off his spot-lamp, and swung the car round, reflecting savagely that he should have known better than to have trusted to his cousin Felicity's enthusiastic but incomplete directions. If he had had the sense to follow the usual road he would have been at Greythorne by now. As it was, Felicity's 'short way' had already made him late for dinner.</p> <p>He drove on rather cautiously down a bumpy lane flanked by quickset hedges. Wreaths of autumn mist curled across the road and further exasperated him. He passed a road winding off to the left, but it looked unpromising, and he bore on towards Pittingly. </p> <p>The lane twisted and turned its way through the Weald. There were apparently no houses on it, nor did Pittingly &#x2014; a place towards which Mr Amberley was fast developing an acute dislike &#x2014; materialise. He glanced at his watch and swore gently. It was already some minutes after eight. He pressed his foot down on the accelerator and the long powerful Bentley shot forward, bounding over the rough surface in a way that was very bad for Mr Amberley's temper. Pittingly seemed to be destined to remain a mystery; no<br> sign of any village greeted Mr Amberley's rather hard grey eyes, but round a sharp bend in the lane a red tail-light came into view.</p> <p>As the Bentley drew closer its headlights, piercing the mist, picked out a motionless figure standing in the road beside the stationary car. The car, Mr Amberley observed, was a closed Austin Seven. It was drawn up to the side of the road, its engine switched off, and only its side and tail-lights burning. He slackened speed and saw that the still figure in the road was not that of a man, as he had at first supposed, but of a female, dressed in a belted raincoat with a felt hat pulled low over her forehead.</p> <p>Mr Amberley brought his Bentley to a standstill alongside the little Austin and leaned across the vacant seat beside him. </p> <p>'Is anything wrong?' he said, not without a touch of impatience. Really, if on the top of having lost his way he was going to have to change a wheel or peer into the bowels of<br> the Austin's engine, it would be the crowning annoyance.The girl &#x2014; he guessed rather than saw that she was quite young &#x2014; did not move. She was standing by the off door of the Austin with her hands thrust into the pockets of her raincoat. 'No, nothing,' she said. Her voice was deep. He got the impression that something was wrong, but he had not<br> the smallest desire to discover the cause of the underlying agitation in her curt words.</p> <p>'Then can you tell me if I'm on the right road for Greythorne?' he asked.</p> <p>'I don't know,' she said ungraciously.</p> <p>A somewhat sardonic gleam shot into Mr Amberley's eyes. 'A stranger to these parts yourself, no doubt?' </p> <p>She moved her head and he saw her face for a moment, a pale oval with a mouth he thought sulky. 'Yes, I am. Practically. Anyway, I've never heard of Greythorne. Good night.'</p> <p>This was pointed enough, but Mr Amberley ignored it. His own manners were, his family informed him, abrupt to the point of rudeness, and the girl's surliness rather pleased<br> him. 'Tax your brain a little further,' he requested. 'Do you know the way to Upper Nettlefold?'</p> <p>The brim of her hat threw a shadow over her eyes, but he was sure that she glowered at him. 'You ought to have taken a turning to the left about a mile back,' she informed him.<br> 'Damn!' said Mr Amberley. 'Thanks.' He sat back in his seat and took out the clutch. To turn the car in this narrow lane was not easy. He drove on till he was clear of the Austin and began his manoeuvres. After considerable trouble he got the Bentley round, its head-lamps illuminating the girl and the Austin in two brilliant shafts of light. As the car swung round she flinched, as though the sudden blaze of light startled her.</p> <p>Mr Amberley saw her face, chalk-white, for a moment before she averted it. Instead of straightening up the car he kept it stationary, his foot hard on the clutch, his hand mechanically grasping the gear-lever. The headlights were directed full into the smaller car and showed Mr Amberley something queer. There was a small hole in the windscreen, with splinters radiating out from it in a star shape. He leaned forward over the wheel, staring. 'Who's in that car?' he said sharply.</p> <p>The girl moved quickly, shutting the interior of the Austin from Mr Amberley's keen scrutiny. 'What has it got to do with you?' she said breathlessly. 'I've told you the way to<br> Upper Nettlefold. Why don't you go?</p> <p>Mr Amberley pushed the gear-lever into neutral and put on his brake. He got out of the car and strode towards the girl. Now that he was close to her he saw that she was goodlooking, a fact that did not interest him, and exceedingly nervous, a fact that aroused all his suspicions.</p> <p>'Very silent, your companion?' he said grimly. 'Get away from that door.'<br> She stood her ground, but she was obviously frightened.</p> <p>'Will you please go? You have no business to molest me in this fashion!'</p> <p>His hand shot out and grasped her wrist. He jerked her somewhat roughly away from the door and peered in. A man was sitting in the driver's seat, curiously immobile. His head was sunk on his chest. He did not look up or speak.</p> <p>The girl's hand shook in Mr Amberley's hold, which had slowly tightened on it. The figure at the wheel did not move.</p> <p>'Oh!' said Mr Amberley. 'I see.'</p> <p>'Let me go!' she said fiercely. 'I &#x2014; it &#x2014; I didn't do it.'</p> <p>He retained his grasp on her wrist, but he was looking at the dead man. The clothing, a dark lounge suit, was disarranged, as though someone had rifled the pockets; the striped shirt was stained with red, and a dark stain ran down the front of the waistcoat.</p> <p>Mr Amberley put out his free hand to touch the slack one inside the car. He did not appear to feel any repulsion. 'Not cold,' he said. 'Well?'</p> <p>'If you think I did it you're wrong,' she said. 'I found him like it. I tell you I wasn't even here!'</p> <p>He ran his hand down over her coat, feeling for a possible weapon. She began to struggle, but found that she was quite powerless in his grip. His hand encountered something hard in the right pocket. Without ceremony he pulled out a small automatic. She stood still. </p> <p>Hatred vibrated in her voice as she said:<br> 'If you take the trouble to inspect it you will find it's fully loaded. The magazine holds seven. It isn't cocked.'</p> <p>'Are you in the habit of carrying loaded guns?' he inquired.</p> <p>'That's my affair.'</p> <p>'Undoubtedly,' he agreed, and lifting the gun sniffed gingerly at the end of the barrel. He let go her wrist and slipped out the magazine. As she had said, it held seven cartridges. Pulling back the breech, he satisfied himself that it was empty. Then he snapped the magazine home and handed the gun to the girl.</p> <p>She took it in a somewhat unsteady clasp. 'Thanks. Satisfied I didn't do it?'</p> <p>'Quite satisfied that you didn't do it with that gun,' he replied. 'Probably you didn't do the actual shooting, but you know something about it.'</p> <p>'You're wrong. I don't know anything. He was like that when I found him.'</p> <p>'Dead?'</p> <p>'No &#x2014; yes, I mean.'</p> <p>'Make up your mind which it is to be,' he recommended.<br> 'Damn you, leave me alone!' she flashed. 'Can't you see I'm upset and don't know what I'm saying?'</p> <p>His cool glance swept over her. 'Since you put it like that; no, I can't. You seem to me remarkably self-possessed. Come on, out with it!

Now her work has taken Margaret back to Darkover, where she must fight against inner voices that are trying to control her as she unravels the secrets of her heritage -- and her destiny.<b>Marion Zimmer</b> was born in Albany, NY, on June 3, 1930, and married Robert Alden Bradley in 1949. Mrs. Bradley received her B.A. in 1964 from Hardin Simmons University in Abilene, Texas, then did graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1965-67. <p> She was a science fiction/fantasy fan from her middle teens, and made her first sale as an adjunct to an amateur fiction contest in <b>Fantastic/Amazing Stories</b> in 1949. She had written as long as she could remember, but wrote only for school magazines and fanzines until 1952, when she sold her first professional short story to <b>Vortex Science Fiction</b>. She wrote everything from science fiction to Gothics, but is probably best known for her <b>Darkover</b> novels. </p><p> In addition to her novels, Mrs. Bradley edited many magazines, amateur and professional, including <b>Marion Zimmer Bradley's Fantasy Magazine</b>, which she started in 1988. She also edited an annual anthology called <b>Sword and Sorceress</b> for DAW Books. </p><p> Over the years she turned more to fantasy; The House Between the Worlds, although a selection of the Science Fiction Book Club, was "fantasy undiluted". She wrote a novel of the women in the Arthurian legends -- Morgan Le Fay, the Lady of the Lake, and others -- entitled <b>Mists of Avalon</b>, which made the NY Times best seller list both in hardcover and trade paperback, and she also wrote <b>The Firebrand</b>, a novel about the women of the Trojan War.

W. Tozer wondered about the End Times. How should we read the book of Revelation? What does it mean for how believers live our lives? In this never-before-published book, today&#x2019;s Christians can learn from one of the twentieth century Church&#x2019;s most profound thinkers and pastors. Tozer&#x2019;s teaching on Revelation offers a fresh and timely perspective on the purpose of prophecy, which the renowned writer believed was to lift our gaze from the immediate to the eternal. <i>Preparing for Jesus&#x2019; Return </i>offers readers a panoramic view of what is to come and explores what it means for individuals, churches and the world.<br></p><p><b>A.

Her last novel, The Blue Flower, was the most admired novel of 1995, chosen no fewer than nineteen times in the press as the `Book of the Year&#39;. It won America&#39;s National Book Critics&#39; Circle Award. She died in April 2000, at the age of eighty-three.First published in London in 1984, this biography unveils the life, personality, and art of the almost-forgotten English poet Charlotte Mew (1869-1928), whose poetry impressed such contemporaries as Hardy, Woolf, Sitwell, and Pound. Fitzgerald brings Mew to life through accounts of the poet's interactions with her colleagues. By interrelating Mew's work and life experiences, Fitzgerald comments, and allows Mew to comment, on an inner struggle intensified by insanity, poverty, sexual frustration, and the death of loved onesa struggle that ends with suicide.

This tapestry represents the strength of a people who have been constant in their commitment to their ancestry, new homelands, and the future generations to follow, always amid an atmosphere of hard work laced with an appetite for fun. Visual artist and first-time author Pearl Sofaer takes the reader through the color and clamor of her beloved Bombay market. We share her histories and adventures, as well as those of her cousins, who grew up in cities from Baghdad to Bombay. We get acquainted with cousins who survived a World War and escaped from a farhud. We take a dark journey on a freighter through the Suez Canal but also a cheery cruise on the Queen Elizabeth I. London and New York come alive, as do Jerusalem and Sydney. Throughout, we are generously fed and offered new and traditional foods, with recipes so we can replicate these tastes be they spicy from Mesopotamia or soothing from Wellington in our homes. The fun of dance and song enliven the pages of her childhood in India, as does the joy of eating with cousins from around the world. You are left with a feeling that this family clan loves life and has grabbed it with hard work and enthusiasm. As you move from chapter to chapter and culture to culture, you feel Pearl s constant joy, passion, and commitment to her heritage, to her mother cities, Bombay and Baghdad, and to the love she has for the friends of her childhood, her special cousins.</p><p>Pearl Sofaer was born and grew up in Bombay, India. Her large family originated in Baghdad and Kirkuk, Iraq, before migrating to Burma and India during the latter part of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. After the partition of India in 1947, most of her family moved to the four corners of the globe to become a living collage of many nations. One of the results of their rich heritage and embrace of their new cultures has been an expanded repertoire of cuisine, grounded, of course, by the traditional foods of Iraq and India. Food continues to be the centerpiece of celebrations hosted by members of this vast clan, many of who generously opened their kitchens to their cousin. Educated in India and England, Pearl earned a masters degree in mediation in the United States. Besides writing, Pearl is an accomplished visual artist and singer. She has shown her paintings and sculptures in art exhibitions throughout the San Francisco Bay Area and has performed at the Northwest Folklife Festival in Seattle, Southern Oregon University, and elsewhere. In addition, she served as a cantor for the Barah Congregation for more than 10 years. She currently resides in the San Francisco Bay Area near her children and grandchildren.

Lana is a psychology major with a knack for working with troubled children. She takes a job as a babysitter for a disturbed young boy named Luke, but it&#x2019;s not just the experience she craves&#x2014;there&#x2019;s something about Luke that unsettles Lana to her core. Maybe it&#x2019;s because Luke seems to know Lana a little too well. Maybe it&#x2019;s because she&#x2019;s a firm believer in keeping your enemies close.

It is a profoundly rich, subtly delineated series of sketches of self and others (among the latter, internationally famous British actors such as Gielgud and Richardson). With an Introduction by Piers Paul Read.Already a bestseller in England, Guinness's memoir is less autobiography than fond recollections of the many friends ("blessings") he has accumulated in his long theatrical career. In loosely organized chapters, most centered around one of the major influences in his life (e.g., Sybil Thorndike, John Gielgud), Guinness wanders back and forth through time. The threads of Guinness's own career, marriage, and religious searching wind through these chapters in an amusingly self-deprecatory way. He describes his career as a naval officer during World War II as "the best performance I have given," in a chapter full of hilarious and hair-raising episodes.

Full of tips and tools for going bare, this is the essential handbook for people who want to move their body, connect with the earth, and feel physically and psychologically more alive.</p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Michael Sandler</b></p> <p><strong>Q. You share an inspiring story of how you came to abandon footwear that demonstrates you needn&#x2019;t be a superhuman to walk without shoes. Can you describe the physical challenges that led you to barefoot walking?</strong></p> <p>A. In 2006 I was involved in a near death accident. This debilitating injury left me with a titanium femur and hip, an inch leg-length discrepancy, and a total of 10 knee operations, plus no ACL in my left knee. Doctors didn&#x2019;t know if they could save my leg, nor if I&#x2019;d ever be active again.</p> <p>Many months later, when I first started walking again, my left leg felt like it was falling apart. I went from overuse injury to overuse injury&#x2014;from chronic plantar fasciitis in my feet, to shin splints, then tendonitis in the knee, plus problems with my hips and back.</p> <p>However, everything began to change when I started going barefoot. First off, the swelling, achiness, and inflammation in my joints and legs began to subside. That alone was huge. Then without shoes on, I found myself standing straighter, (and taller!) despite my leg length discrepancy. Feeling the ground helped me step extra-light (gingerly at first), teaching me how to protect my bones and joints. Over time I almost felt like I was floating over the ground. My feet and legs grew stronger, my joints much happier, and my posture improved. Even my incessantly chattering ADHD mind would miraculously go quiet on my barefoot walks. It was both a health-changing and life-changing experience.</p> <p><strong>Q. Why should I walk barefoot?</strong></p> <p>A. Remember how great it feels to walk barefoot through the grass or to feel the sand between your toes on a beach? There&#x2019;s a near-universal joy of going barefoot, one that brings us back to a time when we were kids. Once you go barefoot, it&#x2019;s as if you&#x2019;ve just flipped the on switch for perfect health, helping return your body to a younger, healthier you. Your feet and legs grow stronger, you stand taller, and you have more energy throughout the day. Your immune system gets a boost, your blood pressure may lower, and since barefoot walking is a mindfulness exercise, you begin to experience greater peace of mind. Neuroscientists say it even helps wake up the mind for better focus, concentration, and balance!</p> <p><strong>Q. Is barefoot walking really for everyone? I&#x2019;m not an athlete nor very athletic; will I still enjoy this book?</strong></p> <p>A. Nearly everyone can benefit from Barefoot Walking. While an athlete will get a lot out of this book, it was never specifically designed for athletes. Instead, it&#x2019;s designed for people who want to get moving, get healthy or back into shape, overcome an injury, or just discover the pure joy of natural movement. Everyone can benefit from stronger, healthier feet and legs, and less fatigue and soreness on all joints throughout the body. So barefoot walking&#x2019;s for almost everyone...with the exception of diabetics with advanced neuropathy and those who&#x2019;ve had serious foot challenges or surgery (always check with your doctor prior to starting a new exercise program). For kids, it helps them grow up with stronger bodies, boosted immune systems, and an incredibly healthy muscular-skeletal system&#x2014;scientists would say better focus and concentration and stronger brains too! For seniors, it helps with balance, strong joints, maintaining muscle tone, sharpening the mind, and preventing falls. And for those overweight, it helps them walk extra light, reducing impact on the joints and back. And for everyone, it acts like a fountain of youth, returning us to a state of greater health and vitality!</p> <p>So we&#x2019;ve designed a step-by-step program in the book to be extremely gentle in easing people into things, no matter your fitness level. This way, everyone can benefit from the advice in this book. </p> <p><strong>Q. But I love my footwear. What if I&#x2019;m not ready to give up my shoes? </strong></p> <p>A. We wrote <i>Barefoot Walking</i> to help people heal and grow stronger whether in or out of a shoe. So while we have our bias and think the benefits of direct contact with the earth are very important, we recognize many people may want or need to stay in footwear. So we wrote <i>Barefoot Walking</i> in a way everyone can benefit. In essence, we recommend spending time barefoot whenever possible, and for the rest of the time, using the advice in this book to make the most of the experience in footwear. And for choosing footwear such as minimalist shoes, we spend an entire chapter dissecting footwear and what to look for to keep your feet happy.</p> <p> If you simply can&#x2019;t give up the painful footwear&#x2014;like high heels and most &#x201c;traditional&#x201d; shoes&#x2014;the strength training and stretching exercises we include will still help tremendously with keeping your feet happy.</p> <p><strong>Q. I live in the city; where can I walk barefoot there?</strong></p> <p>A. City sidewalks or paved park paths are great. In the beginning you want a harder surface, which helps us learn to land extra light on our soft and sensitive feet. Think of it this way, you can cheat and hit your heel down hard on the grass, without any problem, but try that once on the pavement, and you&#x2019;d never do it again. So, the hard surfaces help us develop a lighter, more natural stride&#x2014;one every child knows before they start walking in their shoes. Hard surfaces also help you engage more muscles of the foot, and the roughness stimulates the growth of stronger skin too.</p> <p>If you&#x2019;re concerned about safety while the skin is still soft, you can always walk a sidewalk in shoes first to be sure it&#x2019;s safe before you begin. And to keep your feet clean, simply keep cleaning supplies by your front door and wipe off your feet when you get home.</p>MICHAEL SANDLER is a barefoot-running and -walking coach and motivational speaker who has coached athletes, business executives, and medical professionals for nearly 20 years.

He is the author of <i>The Hardworking House</i>. </p><p><b> Introduction </b></p><p> I am fascinated with the idea of the kitchen, what it means and how it is changing. I am an architect by background, a kitchen designer in practice and I work on kitchens around the world. This hook is set around the projects I have done and the ideas associated with comfortable living -- in well-designed environments. It is about how the way we live in our houses is changing; the kitchen now seems to be in the process of slowly occupying the whole downstairs floor space. </p><p> The dynamic behind our use and understanding of kitchen space has altered. For some the kitchen is now becoming an open-plan multipurpose space; for others its new role is partly disguised. I believe the design of most houses in the future will be planned around a thoroughly different version of the kitchen as we know it today. It will have an effect on the way the whole house will be used, radically changing the name, size and function of the main floor of the home. These observations are based on current social, economic, cultural and lifestyle trends that are available for us all to see in people's homes, in articles and through the way we are constantly adapting to contemporary life. Living patterns change so much faster than bricks and mortar. This book explores how redefining the design of the house opens up huge opportunities for a new sociable, active central space with room for several different activities to be played out simultaneously. It will be welcoming, bright, efficiently planned, comfortable and heart-warming -- with more freedom to move around. However, we still need careful design for culinary activities, and much of the advice in this book, on subjects like cooking ergonomics, apply equally well to our current kitchen spaces. </p><p> We need to think imaginatively about what a kitchen is for us individually. We need to explore the story around it, examine its history, its contemporary meaning, its possible future and, most importantly. its design potential. This book is a design manual at heart, and it appeals to thinking differently about how you imagine a kitchen. Its design needs to succeed on so many counts, from ergonomics through to layout, from lighting to the pleasure of using it. If you don't enjoy being in the space, you won't linger or have an inclination to use it. </p><p> Most new homeowners want to install their own kitchen as soon as they move in -- reflecting personal views and the latest in interior design concepts or fashions. However, the issues are larger than they may appear. Today hardly a single house in the U.S. or Europe has the right space to accommodate the new expectations for the kitchen, in terms of size, location or relationship to the other rooms and the outside. </p><p> When you have finished remodeling your kitchen space and are enjoying your first proverbial sip of wine, remember as you look across the room, scanning its textures, shapes and colors, that it all started with an idea. It always surprises me how much power ideas have and how important it is to have a strong vision and stick with it. So when you are going through the sometimes tough, awkward, or trying moments on the way there, keep this moment in mind. It will be worth it. I hope this book makes it a more exciting and successful task. A great kitchen is at the heart of every happy family and every contented soul. </p><p> Johnny </p></p><h2>The Treasure of Guatavita / El Tesoro De Guatavita (Fifth World Tales) (English and Spanish Edition)</h2><p>The three-part story of Guatavita&#39;s treasure parallels stages of Colombian civilization.</p><p>Text: English, Spanish</p><h2>Outer Space (Discovery Kids)</h2><p>Discover the secrets of outer space.

Debunking the outrageous claim by the notorious Lancashire forger Shaun Greenhalgh that he produced the mesmerizing portrait of a young girl that zoomed into the art world limelight in 2009, Hewitt proves that Leonardo was on intimate terms with both the sitter &#x2013; Bianca Sforza, teenage daughter of the Duke of Milan &#x2013; and her husband, Galeazzo Sanseverino, the Duke&#x2019;s Army Captain, effective Number Two and, as Hewitt convincingly demonstrates, the subject of Leonardo&#x2019;s enigmatic portrait The Musician. Hewitt brings the tragic Bianca to life, suggests why and by whom she was likely murdered,and explains why her Leonardo portrait was included in one of the most lavish books ever produced &#x2013; whose co-illustrator, Giovan Pietro Birago, was paid even more than Leonardo. Finally, in one of the most significant artistic discoveries of recent times, Hewitt shows how Birago&#x2019;s artistic colleagues had no hesitation in lampooning the venerable Leonardo as a Ginger-Haired Gay.<p>&#x2018;A remarkable book and a work of impressive scholarship yet eminently readable, helped along by the author&#x2019;s characteristic light touch, the snapshots of the major players and the quality of the illustrations.

Detailed descriptions of their step-by-step construction methods are included, and the adoption of tools and methods from non-Indian culture as shortcuts are noted (such as the use of canvas and roofing tar, duct tape and C-clamps).

The author is one of the few outsiders to have learned the ancient craft of birchbark canoe making from the Algonquins, and in <b>Building a Birchbark Canoe</b>, he not only shares this skill but invites readers to appreciate the cultural significance of an elegant and practical craft that might otherwise be lost to history. </p></p><p>&#34;With Building a Birchbark Canoe, David Gidmark continues his already significant contribution to material culture studies of Algonquin tribes in northeastern North America. Meticulously detailed descriptions of the step-by-step construction methods of traditional builders provide a penetrating insight into regional variations of the basic Algonquin repertoire. Particularly noteworthy is the adoption of tools and methods from the dominant non-Indian culture as shortcuts in building -- the use of canvas and roofing tar, for instance, to seal stitching in the canoe in place of the aboriginal deerskin and spruce gum pitch or the acceptance of duct tape and C-clamps by a builder still employing the crooked knife.

Originally in paperback.</p><p>0n the remote Greek Island of Thasos, a German Albatros, a vintage World War I fighter plane, has swooped out of the blazing blue sky to attack a modern U.S. Air Force base, nearly destroying its fleet of F-105 Starfire jets. Thirty miles offshore, piloting a Catalina en route to the American scientific research vessel First Attempt, Dirk Pitt hears and responds to the Brady Field emergency call. He blows the Albatros back into the oblivion from which it came, ripping open a mammoth half-century-old conspiracy in the process. <p></p> <p> Pitt has come to the Aegean to hunt down the mysterious saboteur preying on <i>First Attempt</i> -- the ship's mission is to search for a missing evolutionary link, a rare and possibly extinct fish -- but connecting the sabotage on board to the attack on Brady Field, Dirk Pitt knows he's fishing for a shark: a human shark that smells blood. </p> <p> The adventure begins with Teri. She's a glamorous modern Greek goddess in a red bikini, devastatingly beautiful, devastatingly dangerous, and the key to a vast drug-smuggling ring about to bring off a lethal billion- dollar deal. As much as she's willing to reveal to Pitt, there's one secret she holds back: the truth about a missing Nazi war criminal now ruling over a corrupt empire. For decades he has managed to elude international authorities, remain one step ahead of the world's top investigators, and destroy all his enemies, except one: Dirk Pitt. </p> <p> From a thrilling aerial dogfight to heart-stopping hand-to-hand combat, Dirk Pitt follows a trail of blood, treachery, and terror into the depths of a cavernous undersea labyrinth. There, in the legendary Pit of Hades, the action explodes in a climax of unparalleled excitement, as Pitt confronts the brilliance and brutali- ty of a sinister nemesis with a genius for Death. </p><b>Clive Cussler&nbsp;</b>is the author of more than fifty books in five bestselling series, including Dirk Pitt, NUMA Files, Oregon Files, Isaac Bell, and Fargo.

While a truck driver, he began to write articles for a local newspaper, and soon after joined the crusading magazine <i>Po Prostu</i> as the editor of the literary section. In 1956, his short story collection <i>A First Step in the Clouds </i>won him immediate acclaim. It was followed by T<i>he Eighth Day of the Week</i>, and two other novels, <i>The Graveyard </i>and <i>Next Stop&#x2014;Paradise</i>. But when publishers refused to bring out his books, H&#x142;asko traveled to Paris and published them in the �migr� journal <i>Kultura</i>. It was a fateful decision: the Polish authorities gave him the choice of returning home and renouncing his work or staying abroad forever. He chose the latter, and spent the rest of his life in Western Europe, Israel, and the United States. He developed a reputation as a hard drinker and brawler, and was often in and out of prisons and psychiatric clinics. In 1966, Roman Polanski brought H&#x142;asko to Hollywood to work as a screenwriter, but while there, he got into a fight with the composer Krzysztof Komeda, who died from his injuries a few days later. Six months afterward, H&#x142;asko died from a fatal mixture of alcohol and sleeping pills.

The unnamed narrator relates his twisted view of life so transparently that we can see through his demented thoughts to the reality beneath. He thinks that everything happening in his decaying urban neighborhood holds a personal message for him and when he decides his destiny is to kill a hideously ugly woman, it is clear that only he sees any deformity. In the details of his madness (an obsession with numbers, a fascination with and repugnance for the flesh, his pathetic fallacy, etc.), the book vaguely recalls such great works of monomania and solipsism as Samuel Beckett's Three Novels, but any other comparison is invidious. Like the surrealist illustrations that objectify the narrator's visions, this novel is occasionally distasteful but mostly unmoving. December 15<br>Copyright 1985 Reed Business Information, Inc.A nameless, paranoid narrator, compelled by mysterious warnings and sourceless messages, sets out to kill a deformed waitress whom he feels wants to die. With every revelation of the narrator's bizarre lifestyle and unusual acquaintances, the reader is less sure of what can be believed, until the line between actuality and fantasy disappears completely. McDowell has crafted an explicit and unusual nightmarish vision of contemporary urban life that embraces the range of social and sexual maladjustment. The narrator's calm, understated recitation of the unsavory events only heightens the horror; the fine illustrations match the surrealistic mood perfectly. An offbeat, puzzling, and disturbing work that should interest even the most jaded fans of horror fiction. Eric W.

Woody loved babies and he loved trains. His rail journeys across the country inspired some of his most famous songs, including "This Train is Bound for Glory" and "This Land is Your Land." His song "New Baby Train" was recently recorded for the first time by Kim Wilson on the CD, Daddy O Daddy.<br><br>Marla Frazee has created many acclaimed picture books, including the lullaby Hush, Little Baby, a Folk Song with Pictures. As a longtime fan of Woody Guthrie and American roots music, Frazee approached this project with a desire to capture Woody's spirit, playfulness, and era. She visited train museums, studied photographs of the Dust Bowl, and listened to a lot of Woody's music while working on this book. She works in a small cabin in the backyard of the house she shares with her husband and three sons in Pasadena, California.<br>PreSchool-Grade 1&#x2013;Guthrie's song is brought to life by Frazee's gouache illustrations, which tell a story all their own. A guitar-playing narrator and his younger siblings sit together on their front porch, as the boy tries to explain where babies come from. The text reads, "I guess little babies come along/just about any way they can./Cars, trucks, tractors, airplanes,/any way they can come." In subsequent illustrations, the children dash off, wait for a train together, and watch as their brother climbs aboard. Babies also wait for the train and when it arrives, they line up, all sizes, shapes, and colors, with diapers dragging and tickets ready. The narrator tells their tale as the train races through hill and dale, clouds and sky, to deliver its cargo. On the way, the little ones are served bottles of milk, take naps, and then, one by one, are dropped off at their new homes. The boy brings the last one to his house, where the entire family welcomes the new arrival. The brown palette of the artwork and the clothing of the characters give this book a Depression-era look, while the technique of using lines to fill the backgrounds provides a constant sense of motion. Swirling clouds surround a train that doesn't need tracks and at times looks like it's flying to its destination.

This "seventh stream," which drew from existing forms of pop music, began as a youth movement of rebellion and remains a worldwide banner of youth in search of alternatives.<br><br>"Rocknroll" emerged, he shows persuasively, from the successive meeting and melding of the other six "streams"&#x2015;pop, black pop, country pop, jazz, folk, and gospel. He chronicles how these were shaped by struggles over musical property rights, and by the new technologies of radio and phonograph record.<br><br>The most decisive clash was between the New York based music publishers and the radio broadcasters. Their decades long contest resulted in many cultural changes. The basic unit shifted from sheet music to the phonograph record. The radio disc jockey in small, independent radio stations became the new focal point for all the popular musics. New venues, audiences, and talent appeared throughout the nation. <br><br>The appearance of "rocknroll" marked a significant cultural moment, argues Ennis. This "seventh stream" was part of an explosive efflorescence in all the American arts after World War II.

It is this seeing that gives her poems their joy. But it is the unflinching realization that &#39;you love things that can&#39;t help leaving&#39; and that, &#39;you can&#39;t stop/ yourself becoming/ all the white,/ expressionless snow&#39; that gives the poems their strength&#34;--Louis Jenkins.</p><p>Kirsten Dierking (born 1962) is an American poet from Minnesota.

What exactly happened? Could it have been prevented? How and why did so much acrimony and bad information arise from the ashes of the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a quiet field in Pennsylvania? And what remains unresolved? What is certain: Discord and dissent continue to this day.<br><br>Beginning with the first brutal actions of the hijackers aboard American Airlines Flight 11, <i>The Eleventh Day</i> tracks the precise sequence of events and introduces the players: pilots, terrorists, the airliners&#x2019; passengers, and the innocents who died on the ground. Drawing on previously classified records and raw transcripts, Summers and Swan investigate the response of President Bush and the U.S. military that day, and the failure to intercept the hijacked airliners. They document the untruths told afterward by U.S. officials and, as a counterpoint, thoroughly consider the contentions of the &#x201c;9/11 truth&#x201d; movement. With meticulous research, they examine the personalities of the men behind the onslaught, analyze the motives that drove them, and expose the U.S. intelligence blunders that preceded the attacks. They note how afterward&#x2014;without good evidence&#x2014;the Bush administration persisted in trying to link&nbsp; 9/11 to Iraq. And they confront, finally, the question the 9/11 Commission&#x2019;s report blurred: Were the terrorists backed by powerful figures in another foreign nation&#x2014;one the U.S. had long viewed as a friend?<br><br>Riveting, revelatory, and unforgettable, thoroughly sourced and complete with extensive endnotes, <i>The Eleventh Day</i> is the essential one-volume work on a pivotal event in our history.</p><p><strong>Guest Reviewer: Jean Sasson on <em>The Eleventh Day</em> </strong> <br> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <em><strong>Jean Sasson</strong> is an American writer and humanitarian whose work centers on women in the Middle East and the injustices that they suffer at the hands of patriarchal societies.

Together they have written the definitive book on 9/11. <p><em>The Eleventh Day: The Full Story of 9/11 and Osama Bin Laden</em> turns back the clock, taking us to a black day filled with blue skies. A day that began so normally became a day that no one can forget, a day that ended with countless questions, many of which have remained unanswered, until now. <em>The Eleventh Day</em> provides the answers to the questions we have been seeking since that fateful day, now ten long years ago.</p> <p>From the first page, <em>The Eleventh Day</em> rekindles many memories. The horrifying sights of American Airlines flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 crashing into the twin towers and the American Airlines Flight 77 disappearing into the bowels of the Pentagon were such extraordinary phenomena that that few of us could believe what we were seeing. While we understood that a powerful enemy was near, we did not know its face.</p> <p>Witnesses to the events were hit by one shock after another, from the collapse of the towers to the attack upon the Pentagon to the shattering end of United Flight 93. By the time that last planeload of innocent passengers disappeared forever into the soil near to Shanksville, Pennsylvania, the national tally of loss was staggering.</p> <p>What new horror would come next? Innocent victims lay dead, unaware of why they had died; family members of victims were stunned by grief; Americans in every city and town were gripped with white anger.</p> <p>Little did we know that our representatives in the White House had received ample warnings. But now we know, for <em>The Eleventh Day</em> is like a carefully crafted map. Summers and Swan have drawn this map after poring through endless documents, interviewing countless witnesses, and researching the movements of the 19 attackers, bringing the facts together as never before.</p> <p>For months, opportunities were missed at every turn. Before the inauguration of President Bush, The Commission on National Security was ready to issue their final report which concluded that an attack &#x201c;on American soil&#x201d; was likely in the not-too-distant future. The Commission members requested a meeting with the incoming president and vice-president (Bush and Cheney) before the inauguration. Shockingly, the commission members never got their meeting, not then, and not later. No one ever called them back.</p> <p>We also learn that Clinton&#x2019;s Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations, Brian Sheridan, personally warned National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice that al-Qaeda was &#x201c;not an amateur-type deal...It&#x2019;s serious stuff, these guys are not going away.&#x201d; Amazingly enough, Sheridan reports that Rice listened but <em>asked no questions</em>. Sheridan recalls that he offered to brief the incoming officials on al-Qaeda, but no one in the new administrator took him up on the offer.</p> <p>The authors tell us that the governments of Israel, France and Egypt issued warnings of an upcoming al-Qaeda attack in the United States. All were ignored.</p> <p>As time passed, several more opportunities were missed. Only a few days before 9/11, suspicions from instructors at the Pan Am International Flight Academy in Minneapolis over new student Zacarias Moussaouri prompted the manager to alert the local FBI. Moussaouri&#x2019;s leading questions about the &#x201c;damage an airliner could cause if it collided with something&#x201d; had aroused concerns. The local FBI official reacted quickly and Moussaouri was detained on grounds of an expired visa. Although the lead agent sent 70 messages to the head office for approval for search warrants, he was blocked at every turn. Only after 9/11 was it discovered that Moussaouri was part of a team to ram airplanes into buildings.</p> <p>And this is only one example of many that Summers and Swan bring to light in this book. Did the American government fail the American people? Tragically and sadly, the answer is: yes.</p> <p>The publisher&#x2019;s book jacket says that: &#x201c;<em>The Eleventh Day</em> is the essential one-volume work on a pivotal event in our history.&#x201d;</p> <p>I couldn&#x2019;t have said it better.</p> <p></p><b>Anthony Summers</b> is the award-winning author of seven bestselling nonfiction books.

The threat comes from the fourth branch of government&#x2014;the biggest branch&#x2014;and the only branch not in the Constitution: the federal bureaucracy. The bureaucracy imposes thousands of new laws every year, without a single vote from Congress. The bureaucracy violates the rights of Americans without accountability&#x2014;persecuting adoptive parents, denying veterans quality healthcare, discriminating against conservatives and Christians for partisan purposes, and damaging our economy with job-killing rules.<br> <br>Americans are bullied by the very institutions established to protect their right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.<br> <br>Our nation&#x2019;s bureaucrats are on an undemocratic power trip.<br> <br>But Sekulow has a plan to fight back. We can resist illegal abuse, we can reform a broken system, and we can restore American democracy. This book won&#x2019;t just tell you how to win, it will show you real victories achieved by Sekulow and the American Center for Law and Justice.<br> <br>Unless we can roll back the fourth branch of govern�ment&#x2014;the most dangerous branch&#x2014;our elections will no longer matter. <i>Undemocratic</i> is a wake-up call, a call made at just the right time&#x2014;before it&#x2019;s too late to save the democracy we love.</p><p>Jay Sekulow&nbsp;is widely regarded as one of the foremost free speech and religious liberties litigators in the United States, having argued twelve times before the US Supreme Court in some of the most groundbreaking First Amendment cases of the past quarter century. As chief counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), he is a renowned constitutional attorney, an international expert on religious liberty, and an acclaimed and distinguished broadcaster. Jay is a passionate advocate for protecting religious and constitutional freedoms with an impressive track record of success. His steadfast determination and commitment to protecting these freedoms is expansive with his work resulting in a lasting impact across America and around the world. He is a member of President Donald Trump&#x2019;s legal team, and he is also a popular talk radio host and&nbsp;regularly appears on major media, including Fox News, CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, and other outlets.Undemocratic 1<p></p> ONE DAY IN MAY<p></p> <br>I have a unique vantage point from my office in Washington, D.C. My building, in the heart of Capitol Hill, is directly across the street from the Supreme Court of the United States. The Justices literally drive by my office each day that the court is in session. From my window I can see the chambers where the Justices and law clerks spend their days crafting legal opinions that impact all of us. There have been many nights when I have seen the glow of the lights emanating from those chambers as the final touches are put in place. It is an awe-inspiring location. From the white marble columns on the exterior to the expansive courtroom where the oral arguments take place, the building represents power and stability. One of the most impressive aspects of the building is the depiction of great lawgivers carved into the marble. Each time I enter the courtroom, I glance up at those lawgivers, including Moses holding the Ten Commandments written in Hebrew.<br> <br>For three decades I have had the privilege of arguing cases before the Supreme Court representing a wide range of legal issues including: religious liberty, prayer and Bible clubs in public schools, free speech, and defending the unborn&#x2019;s fundamental right to life, and campaign finance reform. I even argued a case before the Supreme Court involving the Ten Commandments Monument in Utah. My team and I won 9&#x2013;0. Admittedly, it is one of my favorite cases, as I was able to reference the Supreme Court building&#x2019;s own depiction of Moses holding the Ten Commandments.<br> <br>The judiciary, our third branch of government, is powerful. After all, the Supreme Court interprets the Constitution and that impacts each of us. It is not, however, the most powerful branch. From my office, I also have a great view of the Capitol dome. I have often taken guests up to the top floor of our building to view the Capitol. The lit dome in the evening sends the clear message that legislators are handling serious business. The Senate office buildings are just across the street from the front door to my building. In fact, after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the security perimeter was moved directly in front of our offices. When the anthrax attack took place days after 9/11, the surveillance devices and air monitoring equipment were placed just a few feet from our main entrance. The security in the area is still very tight, as it should be&#x2014;these are the buildings that house our legislature, our second branch of government. This branch represents the people, and it&#x2019;s where our laws are constructed. And yet, as powerful as the legislative branch of government is, it is not the most powerful branch.<br> <br>I can hop into a cab and after a short five-minute drive I am at the White House. I have had the incredible privilege of being in the Oval Office, discussing major issues with President Bush, ranging from judicial nominations to terrorism. It is an experience that is hard to put into words. When you are seated next to the president of the United States, the commander in chief of our armed forces, you realize quickly that what takes place in that office not only impacts each of us, the impact is felt around the globe. The executive branch of government and the president are powerful. There is no doubt about it. But I submit to you that the executive branch is not the most powerful.<br> <br>The most powerful branch of our government is located around the corner from the Supreme Court building, a few streets over from the Capitol, and a couple of blocks from the White House. These buildings are scattered around D.C. house agencies&#x2014;the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs, the Labor Department, and many others. These agencies are run by bureaucrats. And these unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats destroy our liberty and threaten our democracy. We are in serious peril because of this&#x2014;the most powerful branch of government we did not even learn about in high school civics class.<br> <br>The problem is, the Constitution does not provide for a fourth branch of government. Yet we have one. We have created an unconstitutional, self-sustaining monster that is swallowing our democracy. Our constitutional republic hangs in the balance. I keep a diary with me where I note significant events in my legal practice. My entry on May 10, 2013, was a game changer.<br> <br>The first email&#x2014;marked &#x201c;URGENT&#x201d;&#x2014;hit my inbox at 10:17 a.m., just minutes before my radio program goes live on air. The message was simple: Lois Lerner, then the head of exempt organizations at the Internal Revenue Service, had &#x201c;apologized&#x201d; to conservative and Tea Party groups for intentionally subjecting them to heightened IRS scrutiny.<br> <br>My first feeling was vindication. More than a year earlier, dozens of Tea Party and other conservative groups had contacted me, all telling me the same story. The IRS was delaying their tax exemption applications and requiring them to answer&#x2014;under penalty of perjury&#x2014;appallingly broad questions, questions that violated the constitutional rights of American citizens.<br> <br>The IRS delayed at least one pro-life group because the agency subjectively determined1 that the group&#x2019;s &#x201c;presentations make substantial use of inflammatory and disparaging terms and express conclusions more on the basis of strong emotional feelings than of objective evaluations&#x201d;&#x2014;as if the liberal nonprofit organizations like Planned Parenthood or the American Civil Liberties Union don&#x2019;t make arguments &#x201c;on the basis of strong emotional feelings.&#x201d;<br> <br>We took the cases, notified the IRS of our representation, and publicly called on Congress to take action, by holding hearings to investigate IRS abuse. In response, the IRS denied all wrongdoing, and the mainstream media of course backed the Obama administration&#x2019;s taxing agency, with the New York Times even claiming that in scrutinizing the Tea Party, the IRS was merely doing its job.2<br> <br>But with Lois Lerner&#x2019;s apology, everything changed&#x2014;for a few days, anyway. Every major network carried the apology, every major newspaper wrote articles and analyses, and even President Barack Obama went to the White House podium and expressed his deep outrage.<br> <br>And the IRS&#x2019;s actions were outrageous. In fact, they were criminal. And, for a time, the Obama administration seemed to agree. Within days of the IRS&#x2019;s apology, Attorney General Eric Holder declared that the IRS&#x2019;s conduct was &#x201c;outrageous and unacceptable&#x201d; and ordered a criminal investigation.3<br> <br>The conduct of the IRS was, in fact, &#x201c;outrageous.&#x201d; Over a period of years, the IRS singled out conservative and pro-life individuals and organizations for extraordinary audits, unconstitutional questioning, years-long delays in processing applications, and selective leaks of private information.<br> <br>Ultimately, we discovered the IRS went so far as to try to collude with the Department of Justice to prosecute conservatives, to attempt to &#x201c;piece together&#x201d; (to borrow a term from an actual IRS email4) prosecutions of American citizens without a single shred of evidence or a single specific complaint of illegal activity.<br> <br>On May 10, we knew only part of the story, but we knew enough to know the IRS was out of control.<br> <br>Our work on several IRS cases revealed that before approving conservative groups for the same nonprofit status long granted to large liberal organizations like Planned Parenthood, MoveOn.org, and the ACLU, the IRS was not only delaying applications for years, it was asking questions that were themselves unconstitutional.<br> <br>� It wanted to know the names of children tutored by a constitutional education nonprofit.<br> <br>� The IRS wanted log-in information and passwords for conservative websites.<br> <br>� It wanted to know the identity of donors, even when the law allowed donors to remain anonymous.<br> <br>� It demanded to know the details of all communications between conservative nonprofits and any elected official, demanding even details of &#x201c;indirect&#x201d; communications (whatever those were).<br> <br>� It demanded an accounting of all the nonprofit work of even family members of Tea Party leaders, including their membership on church boards.5<br> <br>It attacked pro-life speech as &#x201c;propaganda,&#x201d; and it demanded to know the content even of pro-life prayers.<br> <br>And that was just the tip of the iceberg.<br> <br>My first job out of law school was in the Office of Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service. My experience taught me that the IRS&#x2019;s attacks on the conservative movement went straight to the top of the agency. In her apology,6 Lois Lerner claimed that the misdeeds were the fault of &#x201c;line&#x201d; workers in Cincinnati&#x2014;low-level employees. But we had in our possession letters from IRS offices in California and in Washington, D.C. Some of these letters were signed by Lois Lerner herself.<br> <br>Lerner also implied that the IRS&#x2019;s wrongdoing had stopped, that when the agency learned what the low-level workers were doing, it called a halt to all improper activity.<br> <br>Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, even as Lois Lerner spoke, multiple conservative groups were still waiting for IRS approvals and continued to receive intrusive questions. Some are still waiting for approval years after the &#x201c;apology.&#x201d; For others, it took filing litigation in federal court to get the IRS to do the right thing.<br> <br>Even worse, the very day before she spoke, emails revealed that Lois Lerner was plotting with the Department of Justice and chief of staff of the IRS commissioner to criminally prosecute conservatives for violating tax laws&#x2014;even without any evidence that the laws had been violated.<br> <br>This misconduct was not some minor annoyance for conservatives. It was so widespread&#x2014;affecting every single conservative group that applied for nonprofit status&#x2014;and so egregious that scholars from the American Enterprise Institute argued it may have had a material impact on the 2012 election.7<br> <br>Writing for the AEI&#x2019;s online journal, Stan Veuger explained:<br> <br>The bottom line is that the Tea Party movement, when properly activated, can generate a huge number of votes&#x2014;more votes in 2010, in fact, than the vote advantage Obama held over Romney in 2012. The data show that had the Tea Party groups continued to grow at the pace seen in 2009 and 2010, and had their effect on the 2012 vote been similar to that seen in 2010, they would have brought the Republican Party as many as 5&#x2013;8.5 million votes compared to Obama&#x2019;s victory margin of 5 million.<br> <br>President Obama&#x2019;s margin of victory in some of the key swing states was fairly small: a mere 75,000 votes separated the two contenders in Florida, for example. That is less than 25% of our estimate of what the Tea Party&#x2019;s impact in Florida was in 2010. Looking forward to 2012 in 2010 undermining the Tea Party&#x2019;s efforts there must have seemed quite appealing indeed.8<br> <br>In other words, had the Tea Party continued its proportionate impact on Republican voting, it could have well made up the difference in key states. Instead it found itself under sustained assault from the IRS, an assault that had a real impact.<br> <br>Veuger goes on to explain how the IRS targeting choked off funds that would have gone to Republican candidates:<br> <br>As a consequence [of IRS targeting], the founders, members, and donors of new Tea Party groups found themselves incapable of exercising their constitutional rights, and the Tea Party&#x2019;s impact was muted in the 2012 election cycle. As Toby Marie Walker, who runs the Waco Tea Party, which filed for tax-exempt status in 2010 but didn&#x2019;t receive approval until two months ago, recounted recently: &#x201c;Our donors dried up. It was intimidating and time-consuming.&#x201d; The Richmond Tea Party went through a similar ordeal, and was only granted tax-exempt status in December, right after the election&#x2014;three years after its initial request. Its chairman explained the consequences: the episode cost the Richmond Tea Party $17,000 in legal fees and swallowed time the all-volunteer network would have devoted to voter turnout, outreach in black and Latino neighborhoods and other events to highlight the constitution and &#x201c;the concept of liberty.&#x201d;9<br> <br>The bottom line? A rogue IRS may well have helped keep Barack Obama in the White House. In fact, Lois Lerner in an infamous email said she had hoped to get a job with President Obama&#x2019;s reelection campaign.<br> <br>There is much more to say about this scandal later, but I raise it now to explain a deeply troubling reality, a reality that is shaking our American democracy to its foundations, a reality that could mean the end of American exceptionalism, an end to the concept of American self-government intended by our Founders and lived through our citizens for almost 240 years.<br> <br>When the IRS scandal broke, my phone seemed to ring for days straight. I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve ever gotten as much email before or since. And there was one question that was on everyone&#x2019;s lips: &#x201c;What did the president know and when did he know it?&#x201d;<br> <br>In other words, the scandal was viewed through the prism of Watergate, the legendary scandal that ended the Nixon presidency, with the assumption that it was only truly &#x201c;real,&#x201d; only truly important, if it could bring down the president of the United States.<br> <br>But I was more disturbed by a different thought, a concern that transcends the current occupant of the White House:<br> <br>What if the IRS&#x2014;arguably the nation&#x2019;s most powerful domestic agency&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t actually need a presidential directive to engage in its nationwide persecution of conservatives? What if the IRS acted largely on its own initiative to target Americans, harass them, audit them, humiliate them, and try to prosecute them merely because the IRS disagreed with their political beliefs?<br> <br>That is a much larger problem than the corruption of a single agency. That is the corruption of an entire system of government.<br> <br>And that is the theme of this book.<br> <br>While Americans have been robustly engaged in political debates&#x2014;and participating in vast numbers in elections&#x2014;a new branch of government has been growing in the shadows. A branch that is elected by no one, ignored by the media, protected by the courts and by a complex web of laws and regulations: with job security so great that some federal employees are more likely to die on the job than they are to be fired.<br> <br>This new branch of government&#x2014;personified not just by the IRS but by the entire array of federal agencies, like the Department of Justice, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Labor Relations Board, the Federal Communications Commission, and many others&#x2014;is the federal bureaucracy; it possesses a staggering amount of power, and it is not only increasingly partisan, it is increasingly corrupt and incompetent.<br> <br>Imagine if Congress wrote and enacted far more laws than it does now, but you could never vote the lawmakers out of office.<br> <br>You don&#x2019;t have to imagine it. It&#x2019;s happening.<br> <br>Imagine if congressmen were systematically corrupt, abused their power, and demonstrated rank incompetence, but by law they never had to face the voters.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s our bureaucracy.<br> <br>Imagine if a congressman, once in office, was allowed to hold power until death or retirement, whichever came first.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s our b...</p><h2>Mind Benders Level 5 Workbook - Deductive Thinking Skills Puzzles (Grades 7-12)</h2><p>Mind Benders, our best-selling deductive thinking puzzles, develop logic, reading comprehension, and mental organizational skills that are vital to achieving high grades and top test scores in all subjects.

Can our world support so many people? What kind of world will it be? In this unique, original and important book, Charles C. Mann illuminates the four great challenges we face - food, water, energy, climate change - through an exploration of the crucial work and wide-ranging influence of two little-known twentieth-century scientists, Norman Borlaug and William Vogt. Vogt (the Prophet) was the intellectual forefather of the environmental movement, and believed that in our using more than the planet has to give, our prosperity will bring us to ruin. Borlaug&#39;s research in the 1950s led to the development of modern high-yield crops that have saved millions from starvation. The Wizard of Mann&#39;s title, he believed that science will continue to rise to the challenges we face. Mann tells the stories of these scientists and their crucial influence on today&#39;s debates as his story ranges from Mexico to India, across continents and oceans and from the past and the present to the future. Brilliantly original in concept, wryly observant and deeply researched, The Wizard and the Prophet is essential reading for readers of Yuval Noah Harari&#39;s Sapiens or Jared Diamond&#39;s Guns, Germs and Steel, for anyone interested in how we got here and in the future of our species.</p><p>Charles C.

His narrative supports the contention admirably as he conveys the full import of the campaigns at sea, showing how each was inextricably intertwined with land and air operations. He explains, for instance, how the U.S. Marines' campaign in the Solomons was part of a complex series of naval confrontations remembered as "Guadalcanal," and how the big guns of the American fleet off the Italian coast decisively preserved the American beachhead at Anzio. Boyne elaborates on subjects usually ignored, such as the Allied and Axis mine-laying campaigns, which were phenomenally effective: naval mines sank more than 200 surface warships and thousands of merchant vessels between 1939 and 1945. He is refreshingly outspoken, referring to the "savagely aggressive" American counterattack in the Pacific and the "utter blindness" of Japanese strategic thinking. It is hard to imagine any account that could render more incisively the difference between the contending navies and the reasons for Allied domination in the end. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Book of Soups</h2><p>Provides recipes for cold, fish, cheese, egg, bean, grain, vegetable, meat, and special occasion soups</p><p></p><h2>American Challenge</h2><p>Book: The American Challenge: A New History of the United States Authors: Moretta, Phillips, Allen, Cantrell, Andrews</p><p></p><h2>Ashleigh&#39;s Dream (Thoroughbred, Book 5)</h2><p>Can Samantha ride Fleet Goddess to victory?

Only Haru Reischauer could have written this extraordinary family account, beginning with her two illustrious grandfathers: one, a provincial samurai who became a founding father of the Meiji government; the other, a scion of a wealthy and enterprising peasant family who almost single-handedly developed the silk trade with America. Their remarkable stories, and those of their notable descendants, demonstrate the unbounded vision and determination that explain so much about Japan's legendary success.</p><p>Edwin O. Reischauer was University Professor at Harvard University.&#x201c;<i>Samurai and Silk</i> is beautifully written, with a sense of intimacy that only firsthand experience and family traditions could confer. It is also a work of broad historical value, since both grandfathers played a major role in reshaping Japan and laying the foundations of its modern economic power.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John Gross</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Haru Reischauer] is a sensitive and skilled biographer and storyteller.

Grounded in the nature of God and the call of Jesus Christ, this book is deeply Scriptural and very practical. While primarily focusing on the relationship of justice and law and on the crucial role of legal advocates and legal organizations to serve the poor and oppressed, this book has applications in other areas of the pursuit of justice as well.

He draws out the lessons from the parable of the Good Samaritan and challenges the reader to apply them to our neighborhoods and our neighbors.

Midway through the season, a game-changing strike ripped baseball apart, the first time a season had ever been stopped in the middle because of a strike. Marvin Miller and the MLB Players Association squared off against Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn and the owners in a fight to protect players rights to free agency and defend America's pastime.</p><p>Though a time bomb was ticking as the 1981 season began, the game rose to impressive---and now legendary---heights. Pete Rose chased Stan Musial's National League hit record and rookie Fernando Valenzuela was creating a sensation as the best pitcher in the majors when the stadiums went dark and the players went on strike.</p><p>For the first time in modern history, there were first- and second-half champions; the two teams with the overall best records in the National League were not awarded play-off berths. When the season resumed after an absence of 712 games, Rose's resumption of his pursuit, the resurgence of Reggie Jackson, the rise of the Montreal Expos, and a Nolan Ryan no-hitter became notable events. The Dodgers bested their longtime rivals in a Yankees-Dodgers World Series, the last classic matchup of those storied opponents.</p><p>Sourcing incredible and extensive interviews with almost all of the major participants in the strike, <i>Split Season: 1981</i> returns us to the on- and off-field drama of an unforgettable baseball year.</p></p><p><b>JEFF KATZ</b> is the Mayor of Cooperstown, the "Birthplace of Baseball" and home to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.

As they fought, a nation deprived of its pastime prayed for the return of greats like Reggie Jackson, Fernando Valenzuela, Pete Rose, and Nolan Ryan. Here a gifted writer, who just happens to be the mayor of the baseball mecca of Cooperstown, N.Y., tells the inside story of that split season when baseball ceased to be a kingdom ruled by royal owners and players won recognition for their central role in the grand old game. This is a &#x2018;must read' tale for anyone who ever sat in the bleachers or flipped through the sports page.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Michael D'Antonio, author of Forever Blue, The True Story of Walter O'Malley and the Dodgers of Brooklyn and Los Angeles</i></p><p>&#x201c;In 1981 I had just turned 21 and had saved up enough money to buy a Greyhound bus ticket across the country.

A new star? A comet? </p><p>Neither. It was the death of Venus. </p><p>As if to commemorate the end of NASA's golden couple, our neighbor planet exploded into a brilliant cloud of dust and debris, showering the Earth with radiation and bizarre particles as big as bacteria--wiping out all the crops and half the life in the oceans, frying the ozone layer, forcing survivors to wear protective suits on city streets. </p><p> Days later, a few specks of moon rock kicked up from the last Apollo mission fell upon a lava crag in Scotland. That was all it took. The ground itself began to shimmer, forming pools of luminous, almost liquid dust. Pools that grow larger every day, as the cultists of Infinite Egress drum and chant with apocalyptic joy...</p><p> So begins Stephen Baxter's most ambitious, most exciting, and ultimately most fascinating novel: <em>Moonseed,</em> the story of a menace that falls to Earth from an unimaginably distant past, pushing us to the brink of an <em>extinction event</em> unparalleled in our planet's history. </p><p> For what has demolished Venus, and now threatens Earth itself, is part machine, part life form: a ten-dimensional superstring nanovirus that literally eats rock, transforming it into liquid, and then into molecule-size black holes that devour the very fabric of space time. </p><p> Feasting on Edinburgh's primeval basalt, <em>Moonseed</em> is steadily eating its way toward Earth's core. The death toll rises by the hour as buildings collapse into streets that flow like water; as hundred-foot tsunamis obliterate Seattle and Vancouver; as volcanoes sprout like weeds across the planet's quickly decaying mantle. </p><p>NASA "rock-jockey" Henry Meacher and his Japanese colleague, Blue, race to cut off the virus and save what is left of the Earth. Meanwhile Henry's ex, Geena, straps in with a Russian cosmonaut for a daredevil Moon voyage, ultimately reuniting with Henry and searching for the lunar ice deposits that might make possible the greatest evacuation since Noah braved the Flood. </p><p> And a mother and her young son clamber for the last solid ground in the liquefying Scottish Highlands, under the baleful stars of a dying universe...</p><p> Audacious beyond comparison, grand in conception, and gripping in execution, <em>Moonseed</em> is the first modern novel to do justice to the awesome terror and promise implicit in quantum physics. Like all of Baxter's work, it blazes new paths from which science fiction will surely follow in the years to come, and becomes required reading for anyone wishing to understand the awesome promise--and threat--revealed by modern science.</p></p><p>Stephen Baxter, the much-lauded author of <i>Voyage</i> and <i>Titan</i>, has been praised as a sci-fi writer who gets the science right. This rigor and research are clearly evident in <i>Moonseed</i>, a tale with high-energy physics and space-travel technology in starring roles. It's Baxter's boyish enthusiasm for science--especially space travel--that makes <i>Moonseed</i> so involving.<p> A world-class disaster epic worthy of any Saturday matinee, <i>Moonseed</i> opens with the spectacular, explosive death of Venus, an event requiring energy a thousand billion times the world's nuclear arsenal. As the radioactive blast from the late Venus reaches Earth, scientists scramble to attribute a cause, with massless black holes and elementary particles the size of bacteria pointing towards some sort of superstring as the smoking gun. The pace quickens when the substance that may have caused the demise of Venus is accidentally introduced to Earth. This substance, dubbed <i>moonseed</i>, acts as a geological lubricant: processes that normally take millions of years occur in mere months with moonseed in the picture. Once Scotland and the state of Washington get gobbled up by this rock-eating, 10th-dimensional nano-lifeform, all hell breaks loose and the search turns towards finding safe refuge for humanity on the Moon. The book's second half is a seat-of-your-pants, what-if exploration of space travel and terraforming.</p><p> An over-the-top doomsday yarn by some measures, <i>Moonseed</i> keeps your feet on the ground with good science, good characters, and a good story. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p><p>Stephen Baxter is an acclaimed, multiple-award-winning author whose many books include the Xeelee Sequence series, the Time Odyssey trilogy (written with Arthur C.

But while the performance catapulted her to new status, it did not answer the question of who this former teacher and librarian really is and just what role she plays in influencing her husband and shaping his administration. The Bushes are more effective than the FBI or CIA at keeping secret what goes on behind the scenes at the White House, the ranch, or Camp David.<br><br>Now, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Ronald Kessler draws back that curtain in the first biography of Laura Bush to be written with White House cooperation. Based on interviews with her closest friends and confidantes from childhood to the present, as well as family members and administration heavyweights like Condoleezza Rice and Andrew Card, Kessler paints a portrait of a woman who, even as she ascended to the heights of political fortune and power, never lost touch with the bedrock American values she absorbed in her youth.<br><br>In this unprecedented account, Kessler reveals:<br><br>� How Laura&#x2019;s opinions have brought budget changes to a range of federal agencies and have affected her husband&#x2019;s policies, appointments, and worldview.<br>� Why Laura told her press secretary in May 2001 she did not want to do any more media interviews.<br>� What President Bush said to Laura at the dinner table after giving the &#x201c;go&#x201d; for the invasion of Iraq, and what his father, former President George H.

The book will surprise readers whose knowledge of the first lady comes from cautious media interviews and speeches.<br><br>Laura Bush&#x2019;s approval rating stands at 85 percent. Since opinion polls first began asking about them, no first lady has received a higher rating. This moving biography is the first to penetrate the secret world of the president&#x2019;s stealth counselor who is one of our most admired public figures.</p><p><p>RONALD KESSLER is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of fifteen books, including <i>A Matter of Character: Inside the White House of George W.

He lives in Potomac, Maryland, with his wife, Pamela.</p>1<br>Hostile Terrain<br><br>From the air, Midland looks as if a hurricane had just hit. The few trees are short, like Christmas trees. The grass is yellow, the land flat. Dust coats the paved roads. There are no lakes or rivers. Visitors could be forgiven for thinking they were stepping off onto the moon.<br><br>With annual rainfall of only thirteen and a half inches, Midland is so arid that, to keep their lawns green in summer, residents must water them every day. To create flower beds, they often have to use jackhammers to cut through the brittle crust formed from caliche, a weathered soil rich in calcium. Until the city started mixing more surface water from the Colorado River Municipal Water District with its own well water, tap water would cause brown stains on teeth because it had excess levels of fluoride.<br><br>Two or three times a year, usually in the spring, a bad sandstorm hits, obscuring the sun as in a total eclipse. The sand stings and enters the nostrils. Drivers peering through their windshield cannot see the front of their car. The sand seeps through the frames of windows and doors and piles up on floors and windowsills. Sand frosts the panes as well.<br><br>The wind uproots the tumbleweeds--tangled balls of light, stiff branches that can balloon to the size of a Volkswagen. The tumbleweeds roll before the wind and clump together in masses of five or ten along the cinderblock walls residents build around their backyards to try to keep out the sand. Into this inhospitable environment, on November 4, 1946, Laura Lane Welch was born.<br><br>Located 335 miles west of Dallas in what is known as West Texas, Midland was named for Midway Station, a section house where railroad employees could stay overnight. The Texas and Pacific Railway built the station in June 1881 halfway between Dallas and El Paso, an area crisscrossed by a Comanche trail and wagon roads. The name was changed from Midway Station to Midland on January 4, 1884, when a post office was established. Until Herman N. Garrett moved his herd of sheep there in 1882, the area had no permanent residents. In 1885, Midland County was established with Midland as the county seat.<br><br>Soon, Nelson Morris, a Chicago meatpacker, bought 200,000 acres from the state for his Black Angus ranch and introduced cattle to the area. Farmers began moving in, and by 1920 over 4,600 acres in Midland County were devoted to cotton. In 1923, oil was discovered seventy miles southeast of Midland, touching off a boom that has continued, off and on, to this day. Located at the center of the Permian Basin, which has 22 percent of the nation's oil reserves, Midland would become one of the greatest petroleum-producing areas in the country.<br><br>Laura's ancestors on her father's side can be traced back to England and to Christopher DeGraffenried, a Swiss nobleman born in 1691. DeGraffenried moved to Philadelphia and eventually to Charleston, South Carolina. Laura's paternal grandfather, Mark Anthony Welch, was born in Texas in 1873. He began as a carpenter and became a homebuilder. According to family legend, he became a friend of Samuel Langhorne Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, and sometimes traveled with him. His wife, Marie Lula Lane, was born in Arkansas in 1873. They moved to Lubbock, Texas, 120 miles north of Midland, in 1918.<br><br>As with her father's ancestors, Laura's mother's side goes back mainly to England, except that she is "one-eighth French," according to genealogist Robert Battle, who, along with William Addams Reitwiesner, has traced Laura's origins. In doing so, they discovered that Laura, on her father's side, is a very distant cousin of Senator John McCain. Both are descendants of Allen Valentine, who lived in Virginia in the 1700s and served as a lieutenant colonel with the North Carolina Troops during the American Revolution.<br><br>On her mother's side, Laura also has an ancestor who fought in the Revolution: John Wiseman, a private in the Pennsylvania militia and a descendant of one Abraham Wiseman, who lived in Philadelphia in the early 1700s. While his name sounds Jewish, he was probably a Mennonite, according to the two genealogists.<br><br>Laura's maternal grandfather, Halsey Sinclair Hawkins, was born in 1894 in Little Rock, Arkansas. While delivering mail for the U.S. Post Office, he met his future wife, Jessie Laura Sherrard. Laura's mother, Jenna Louise Hawkins, was born in Little Rock in 1919. But having been gassed in combat during World War I, Hawkins sought out a dry climate, and they settled first in Tyler, Texas, then in the tiny village of Canutillo about twelve miles northwest of El Paso, where they opened what was known as a tourist court on Nuway Road. A precursor of a motel, it had guest cottages, a restaurant, and a small grocery store.<br><br>Laura's father, Harold Bruce Welch, was born in Oklahoma in 1912 and moved with his parents to Lubbock when he was six. In 1944, he married Jenna Hawkins in the military chapel at Fort Bliss. Jenna had attended Texas Western College--now the University of Texas at El Paso--and had been working as a bookkeeper at an El Paso department store when a mutual friend introduced them.<br><br>Harold served during World War II with the Army's 555th AntiAircraft Artillery Battalion as a master gunner. On April 11, 1945, he was among the soldiers who liberated Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp in Nordhausen in central Germany, 150 miles southeast of Hamburg. An estimated 20,000 prisoners were killed at the top secret camp, where prisoners made V2 rockets in underground tunnels as long as two miles. As the Allies advanced, Hitler began sending prisoners to the Bergen-Belsen camp. In what became known as death marches, tens of thousands of prisoners died of starvation or cold in the winter or were shot by SS guards when they could no longer walk.<br><br>"It was said we discovered six thousand political prisoners, but alas, �ve thousand were corpses," said Father Edward P. Doyle, a Catholic chaplain in the 104th Infantry Division, who participated in the liberation with the 555th. "A sight beyond description, mutilated, beaten, starved skeletons. A thousand were 'living' in various stages of decay, merely breathing among the already dead."<br><br>"I can still remember the smell of burning bodies as we entered the camp," said Marvin S. Brettingen, who served with Welch and played cards with him while on maneuvers in Louisiana.<br><br>A month after the liberation, on May 14, 1945, Major General Terry Allen commended Harold's battalion and its efforts against a "fanatic enemy."<br><br>"Frequently in forward positions, under hostile observation, and suffering casualties from deadly direct enemy fire, all members of the 555th AAA Battalion have proved their courage and skill," Allen wrote. Besides destroying eleven Nazi planes and "probably" destroying another eleven planes, the battalion rendered close ground support to the infantry on thirty-four occasions.(1)<br><br>After the war, Harold took a job as a district manager with Universal CIT Credit Corporation in El Paso. When an oil boom created a need for homes for workers, Harold and Jenna moved to Midland, where he became a homebuilder. For some ventures, he joined forces with Lloyd E. Waynick, another builder, and together they formed Waynick and Welch Company. Eventually, Harold would build 200 homes.<br><br>Harold maintained his office in a tiny room off the kitchen of his home at 2500 Humble Avenue. On Sundays, the Welches attended the First United Methodist Church, where Laura was baptized and would later marry. Harold and Jenna were a team. He built the houses, drawing up a rough floor plan and then taking it to a draftsman to finish. Jenna kept the books.<br><br>Jenna was a traditional stay-at-home mother, which was the norm in those days. As in the television show <i>Father Knows Best</i>, Jenna knew all Laura's friends and spent most of her time in the kitchen. She often made chili with red beans, rice, and guacamole.<br><br>"Laura's mom always fixed three meals a day," remembered Jan Donnelly O'Neill, who became friends with Laura in the ninth grade. "Her dad would often be home for lunch. So she was always in the kitchen."(2)<br><br>After living at two other homes in Midland, in 1961, Harold built the three-bedroom ranch house on Humble Avenue that would be Laura's home until she went to college. It was a typical fifties-era suburban neighborhood--kids biking, playing baseball. Laura's friends and neighbors from those days would be her friends for life.<br><br>Harold was a warm man with a slight paunch and a ruddy face. Outside the house, he always wore a fedora, which covered a large bald spot. He was a cutup, full of energy and always cracking jokes. "Harold was really funny, had a great sense of humor," recalled Laura's cousin Mary Mark Welch, whose father was Harold's only sibling. "He was boisterous, happy-go-lucky, and had a very positive attitude." In this respect, friends observe, he was very much like the man she later married.<br><br>"I remember the first time I met her father in Midland," said Janet Kinard Heyne. A Kappa Alpha Theta sorority sister of Laura's, she roomed with her when Laura was working in Dallas and Houston. "Harold was the kind who had so much nervous energy and paced around all the time," she said. "When I first met George, I thought he was like her father. Super-energetic and couldn't sit still."(3)<br><br>Also like her future husband, Harold was intensely sociable. Almost every morning, he would smoke and drink coffee at Johnny's Barbecue with the owners, his friends John and Betty Hackney. Harold called the small restaurant the "Sick Pig" because he thought the pig on a spit painted on the sign outside the place looked like it had been stricken with a grave illness. Occasionally, Harold ate at the restaurant, where customers savored succulent barbecue beef brisket, pork ribs, turkey breast, ham, or German sausage with barbecue sauce lovingly ladled over them. When asked for the ...</p><h2>Facing the Music (Front Porch Paperbacks)</h2><p>Facing the Music, Larry Brown's first book, was originally published in 1988 to wide critical acclaim. As the St. Petersburg Times review pointed out, the central theme of these ten stories &#x201c;is the ageless collision of man with woman, woman with man--with the frequent introduction of that other familiar couple, drinking and violence. Most often ugly, love is nevertheless graceful, however desperate the situation.&#x201d;There's some glare from the brutally bright light Larry Brown shines on his subjects. This is the work of a writer unafraid to gaze directly at characters challenged by crisis and pathology. But for readers who are willing to look, unblinkingly, along with the writer, there are unusual rewards.</p><p><b>Larry Brown</b> was born in Lafayette County, Mississippi, where he lived all his life. At the age of thirty, a captain in the Oxford Fire Department, he decided to become a writer and worked toward that goal for seven years before publishing his first book, <i>Facing the Music</i>, a collection of stories, in 1988. With the publication of his first novel, <i>Dirty Work</i>, he quit the fire station in order to write full time. (The nonfiction book&nbsp;<i>On Fire</i> tells the story of his many years as a firefighter.) Between then and his untimely death in 2004, he published seven more books.&nbsp;He was awarded the Mississippi Institute of Arts and Letters award for fiction and&nbsp;was the first two-time winner of the Southern Book Award for Fiction, which he won in 1992 for&nbsp;<i>Joe,&nbsp;</i>and again in 1997 for <i>Father and Son</i>. He was the recipient of a Lila Wallace-Readers Digest Award and Mississippi's Governor's Award For Excellence in the Arts. The story "Big Bad Love" became the basis for a feature film, as did his novel <i>Joe</i>.&nbsp;The stories in this collection by an able new talent are set in the South. The protagonist of the best piecesincluding the title story and a fine work entitled "Samaritans"is usually a boozy, middle-aged man who can't quite make sense of his life. Although Brown hails from Oxford, Mississippi, the hometown of William Faulkner, his laconic, matter-of-fact style resembles Raymond Carver's more than Faulkner's. Highly recommended.

When he was thirteen years old he was sent to Cotton College, a remote seminary for boys in the West Midlands countryside. For the next five years Cornwell lived under an austere monastic regime as he wrestled with his emotional and spiritual demons. In the hothouse atmosphere of the seminary he strove to find stable, loving friendships among his fellows and fatherly support from the priests, one of whom proved to be a sexual predator.<br><br>The wild countryside around the seminary, the moving power of church ritual and music, and a charismatic priest enabled him to persevere. But while normal teenagers were being swept up by the rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll era, Cornwell and his fellow seminarians continued to be emotionally and socially repressed. Secret romantic attachments between seminarians were not uncommon; on visits home they were overwhelmed by the powerful attractions of the emerging youth culture of the 1950s. But when they returned to Cotton College, the boys were once again governed by the age-old traditions and disciplines of seminary life. And like many young seminarians, Cornwell struggled with a natural adolescent rebelliousness, which in one crucial instance provoked a crisis that would eventually lead to his decision to abandon his dream of becoming a priest. <br><br>Written with tremendous warmth and humor, <i>Seminary Boy</i> is a truly unforgettable memoir and a penetrating glimpse into the hidden world of seminary life.</p></p><p><p>JOHN CORNWELL is the author of the international bestseller<i> Hitler&#x2019;s Pope</i> and of <i>The Pontiff in Winter.</i> An award-winning journalist, he has written for<i> Vanity Fair</i>,<i> </i>the <i>Sunday Times</i> (London),<i> Commonweal,</i> and<i> </i>the<i> Tablet.</i> He directs the Science and Human Dimension Project at Jesus College, Cambridge .</p>Part One<br><br>Father Figures<br>1<br>On my last summer holiday at the minor seminary I ran into my father in the east London suburb of South Woodford. His heavy limp, a handicap from childhood, seemed more labored than I remembered. As he toiled up George Lane his hand motions were like a man steadying a skittish horse on a leading rein. His hair was plastered down with brilliantine and he was wearing a new raincoat, collar turned up in the manner of Humphrey Bogart. He accosted me affably with his familiar limelight smile, as if greeting an invisible audience somewhere above my head. Nobody would have guessed he had left my mother and his five children a year earlier.<br><br>Standing outside Woolworth's, chatting about the new soccer season, he was fishing for something in his trouser pocket. I glimpsed a ten-shilling note. Then he fetched out a large bright horse chestnut, a conker. Buffing it on his sleeve, he handed it over, saying: "Cheerio there, Jack."<br>I stood watching him until he was swallowed up in the lobby of the Majestic cinema, where a matinee was about to begin. He did not look back. I would not lay eyes on him again for forty-five years.<br><br>I was missing him, but he had always been more of a troublesome sibling than an ideal father. In any case, I had other father figures to contend with.<br>2<br>Father James Cooney, pastor of my early adolescent years, was an austere soul. He had a drawn gray face and blood-raw eyelids. His cracked celluloid clerical collar was the color of soiled snow. It was the rigid cheap sort that priests and seminarians could launder in seconds with a damp cloth. He would kneel at the altar rail in our empty church, eyes shut tight, grizzled head listing in concentration. When he looked up toward the tabernacle, he seemed to be adjusting his vision to the scene of his life's mission--the east London district of Barkingside. Father Cooney was in resigned exile from Skibbereen, County Cork.<br><br>From the age of eleven until I departed for the minor seminary, aged thirteen, to begin my education for the priesthood, I served Father Cooney's Mass at seven o'clock every weekday morning in what he called his "old bit of a church," dedicated to Saint Augustine the missionary to the English. On Sundays the people stood three deep in the aisles; latecomers huddled out in the yard. To reduce the pressure he celebrated an extra Mass on the southern border of the parish in a disused army hut next to a pet cemetery, where dogs, cats, and horses were buried beneath headstones. Father Cooney would gaze bleakly out of the hut window, disparaging "the pagan English customs over the way." I served Mass at the Camp, as we called it, before cycling up to Saint Augustine's to assist as censer bearer at the sung High Mass. In the afternoon I returned to serve at Solemn Benediction, when Father Cooney led the singing of his favorite hymn:<br><i><br>Lord, for tomorrow and its needs<br>I do not pray.</i><br><br>But Father Cooney was struggling to supply the needs of tomorrow in the form of a larger church. Holding up the offertory plates he would reproach us: "Copper! Copper! Where's the silver!" In the meantime he was watching the pennies. Around the church and the presbytery he wore a frayed, black-trying-to-be-green cassock. In winter he went shod in army boots; in summer, black canvas sneakers--what we called plimsolls--sometimes without socks. He chopped his own hair. When I stood close to him in the sanctuary on summer days, he smelled like a sack of fertilizer.<br><br>At High Mass, the segment of charcoal cake, painstakingly excised with a razor blade, was minuscule, the incense grains sparse. When I swung the censer high to make the smoke billow, he would come suddenly out of his meditative mode. "Not so briskly, child!" he would hiss. When we buried parishioners in the Catholic section of the local cemetery, the charcoal was a morsel of white ash by the time we reached the graveside. It seemed to me strange, Father Cooney swinging a cold, smokeless censer at the coffin. At Low Mass he would ease a teardrop of wine into the chalice. The candles on the altar were dark, guttering stubs appropriated from Our Lady's votive rack. He would light them at the last moment, and snuff them with a singed pinch before he had even finished the words of the Last Gospel.<br><br>He was a shy man. If we met outside church he would incline his head, silently acknowledging the bond between himself and his daily Mass server. Sometimes he made a peculiar noise, a substitute for saying anything definite: "Wisswiss . . . wisswiss." When the children gathered around him in the school yard he would make a nuisance-fly gesture: "Very good! So! . . . wisswiss . . . Run along now!" Addressing women, young or middle-aged, he would stand sideways on to them, bleakly descrying objects of curious interest in the distance. But I have seen him comforting in his arms a widow wracked with grief at her husband's graveside.<br><br>He was tireless in the service of the sick and the dying. I would see him out in all weathers on his rusty bicycle, visiting the inmates at the Claybury mental asylum and the bedridden at King George V Hospital. Careering unsteadily along the street, narrowly missed by buses and lorries, he gripped the handlebars with one hard-knuckled hand; the other would nurse the Sacrament within his breast pocket.<br><br>He was self-effacing. When he dropped an object from his arthritic hands, he would whisper to himself, bending over painfully: "Wisswiss . . . Imbecile it is!" If he caught the servers fooling around before High Mass, he would mutter: "Boys will be boys as the hills are green far off!" But he could get exasperated with our choir when they droned on beyond the Offertory. "<i>Orate, frates</i> . . . Enough of that!"<br><br>My mother used to say that when you confessed your sins to Father Cooney it was "like going on trial for your life." Often he made me repeat my purpose of amendment: "Say it again . . . As if you meant it, now!" But he always ended with the heartfelt murmur "Be sure now and pray for <i>me</i>--the unworthy sinner."<br><br>On Sundays he would preach on the gospel of the day before straying to his weekly hobbyhorse, the <i>News of the World</i>, which "desecrated the Sabbath by its very existence," lingering hissingly over that final sibilant. Then he would excoriate the barbershops which sold "prophylactics," which I associated in my innocence with mysterious idols of a false religion. "No dacent, upright Catholic gentleman," he would say, "should give custom to such a one as does the Divil's business now!"<br>3<br>Father Cooney recruited me as a candidate for the priesthood in this way. One Sunday evening I arrived at church early for Solemn Benediction. After vesting I looked into the sacristy. The room was silent, deserted. On the press stood the chalice in readiness for Mass the following morning. I had an urge to touch the receptacle. I went on tiptoe across the parquet flooring and grasped the embossed stem of the sacred cup. At that moment I heard a gasp. Looking back, I was seized with terror at the sight of Father Cooney perched on a stool behind the open sacristy door. He followed me with his eyes as I walked slowly past him, trembling, as if I had committed a profanity. He said not a word.<br><br>The following day, after early morning Mass, Father Cooney asked me what I hoped to be when I grew up. I said confidently that I hoped to be a priest. Within a day it was settled that I should try my vocation at a minor seminary, a boarding college where young boys began their long training for the priesthood. When Father Cooney put my name forward to the bishop as a candidate for the priesthood I was approaching my thirteenth birthday. I was already a Johnny-come-lately: many boys of my generation had begun their priestly formation at the age of eleven.<br><br>On the appointed day, my mother took me to an interview with the Right Reverend Bishop George Andrew Beck of Brentwood. She was dressed in her purple coat with padded shoulders, which she kept for special occasions; it was smart but her dress showed a few inches below the hem. I was dressed in my elder brother's navy blue jacket, temporarily stitched up at the sleeves. We sat at the front of the upper deck of the London Transport bus because Mum thought it a treat to have a view of the scenery on a journey. Riding northward from the bus stop outside Trebor's mint factory, we passed Hill's car showroom, festooned with bunting snapping in the spring breeze. Then we crossed the river Roding, with its smell of the sewage plant, and passed under the Central Line railway bridge on our way to the towering Majestic cinema. In all that journey, I reflected, there was not a single sacred image to be seen. That was how I had begun to think.<br><br>Bishop Beck's diocese took in the county of Essex with its new towns and the poor districts of London's East End, but he lived in the prosperous suburb of Woodford Green. The bishop's house was set back from the road amidst clipped shrubberies. A gleaming black limousine stood on the gravel drive. Monsignor Shannon, the vicar general, greeted us at the door. He was a stout man in a black suit, a cigarette perched between his fingers. He had a flushed face as if he had just climbed out of a steaming bath. He spoke to us softly, advising us to address the bishop as "My Lord." He ushered us into a room where the bishop sat at a desk with his back to French windows. He got up and held out his ringed hand for us to kiss.<br><br>He was a lean, dark-haired, exhausted-looking man with a sallow face. He was watching me intently through half horn-rimmed spectacles. I sat bolt upright on a straight-backed ornate chair trying to look alert and decent. He spoke for a while about Father Cooney's recommendation. Looking up at the ceiling, he said: "How lucky you are to have Father Cooney as your parish priest."

He is a contributor to <b>Architectural Digest</b>, <b>The Boston Phoenix</b>, and <b>The Advocate</b>.The gift for character and architectonics Mann displays in his riveting film bios (including <i>Kate</i>) gets stripped out of his third pulpy Provincetown novel, following <i>Where the Boys Are </i>(2003). Mann switches focus from pop novelist Jeff O'Brien and hotelier Lloyd Griffith (longtime companions) to another Provincetown hottie, Jeff's best friend, Henry Weiner, whose complex trek from geek to hustler was a feature of the last book. Henry's a "washashore," as the locals call those who come to Provincetown to live year-round&#x2014;adrift, restless, always on the prowl&#x2014;and is managing Nirvana, the popular guesthouse co-owned by Jeff and Lloyd. Over the course of a Provincetown summer, Henry searches for Mr. Right, meeting and bedding a parade of sexy men: Luke is a sly, possibly psychotic would-be novelist who picks up Henry to get to Jeff; Martin is impossibly old at 45; Gale refuses to drop his pants on the first date; Shane, Henry's ex-, returns with a ring on his finger. Mann gets off some funny lines and smiles wryly on the longings of his characters. There's also a nice side plot in Jeff's nine-year-old nephew-ward JR, who struggles with his latent heterosexuality. Henry's odyssey, however, isn't sustaining, and the resolution falls flat. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Mary&#x161;ka drinks. She rides a bicycle, letting her long hair fly. She butchers pigs, frolics in blood, and leads on the local butcher. She&#x2019;s a Madame Bovary without apologies driven to keep up with the new fast-paced mechanized modern world that is obliterating whatever sleepy pieties are left over from the defunct Austro-Hungarian Empire. &#x201c;The Little Town Where Time Stood Still&#x201d; is told by Mary&#x161;ka and Francin&#x2019;s son and concerns the exploits of his Uncle Pepin, who holds his own against the occupying Nazis but succumbs to silence as the new post&#x2013;World War II Communist order cements its colorless control over daily life. Together, Hrabal&#x2019;s rousing and outrageous yarns stand as a hilarious and heartbreaking tribute to the always imperiled sweetness of lust, love, and life.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>Bohumil Hrabal</b> (1914&#x2013;1997) was born in Brno, Moravia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. More interested in poetry and the life of the brewery managed by his stepfather than in his studies, Hrabal eventually enrolled in the law faculty at Charles University in Prague. The Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1939 led to the closing of the universities and Hrabal did not complete his degree until 1946. Not inclined to practice law and unable to find a publisher for his poetry once the Communist Party came to power in 1948, Hrabal held a long series of odd jobs, including notary clerk, warehouseman, railroad worker, insurance agent, traveling salesman, foreman in a foundry, wastepaper recycling center worker, and stagehand. In 1962 he became a full-time writer, but due to government restrictions was obliged to publish much of his work in underground editions or abroad. The motion-picture adaptation of his novella <i>Closely Watched Trains</i> brought Hrabal international recognition, including the 1967 Academy Award for Best Foreign-Language Film, but only in 1976 was he &#x201c;rehabilitated&#x201d; by the government and permitted to publish select works. By the time of his death&#x2014;he fell from a fifth-floor window in a Prague hospital, apparently trying to feed the birds&#x2014;Hrabal was one of the world&#x2019;s most famous Czech writers and the author of nearly fifty books.

But until recently, scientists didn&#x2019;t understand what in the brain makes it possible.&nbsp;This has all changed in the last decade. Marco Iacoboni, a leading neuroscientist whose work has been covered in <i>The New York Times</i>, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, and <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, explains the groundbreaking research into mirror neurons, the &#x201c;smart cells&#x201d; in our brain that allow us to understand others. From imitation to morality, from learning to addiction, from political affiliations to consumer choices, mirror neurons seem to have properties that are relevant to all these aspects of social cognition. As <i>The New York Times </i>reports: &#x201c;The discovery is shaking up numerous scientific disciplines, shifting the understanding of culture, empathy, philosophy, language, imitation, autism and psychotherapy.&#x201d; <i></i><i></i>&nbsp;<i>Mirroring People </i>is the first book for the general reader on this revolutionary new science. <p></p></p><p>Marco Iacoboni&nbsp;is a neurologist and neuroscientist at the David Geffen School of&nbsp;Medicine at UCLA. He has appeared on <i>Good Morning America</i>, the <i>Early Show</i>, and <i>Morning&nbsp;Edition</i>, among other TV and radio programs.Excerpt<br>NEURO THIS!<br>When we get right down to it, what do we human beings do all day long? We read the world, especially the people we encounter. My face in the mirror first thing in the morning doesn&#x2019;t look too good, but the face beside me in the mirror tells me that my lovely wife is off to a good start. One glance at my eleven-year-old daughter at the breakfast table tells me to tread carefully and sip my espresso in silence. When a colleague reaches for a wrench in the laboratory, I know he&#x2019;s going to work on the magnetic stimulation machine, and he&#x2019;s not going to throw his tool against the wall in anger. When another colleague walks in with a grin or a smirk on her face&#x2014;the line can be fine indeed, the product of tiny differences in the way we set our face muscles&#x2014;I automatically and almost instantaneously can discern which it is. We all make dozens&#x2014;hundreds&#x2014;of such distinctions every day. It is, quite literally, what we do.<br>Nor do we give any of this a second thought. It all seems so ordinary. However, it is actually extraordinary&#x2014;and extraordinary that it feels ordinary! For centuries, philosophers scratched their heads over humans&#x2019; ability to understand one another. Their befuddlement was reasonable: they had essentially no science to work with. For the past 150 years or so, psychologists, cognitive scientists, and neuroscientists have had some science to work with&#x2014;and in the past fifty years, a lot of science&#x2014;and for a long time they continued to scratch their heads. No one could begin to explain how it is that we know what others are doing, thinking, and feeling.<br>Now we can. We achieve our very subtle understanding of other people thanks to certain collections of special cells in the brain called mirror neurons. These are the tiny miracles that get us through the day. They are at the heart of how we navigate through our lives. They bind us with each other, mentally and emotionally.<br>Why do we give ourselves over to emotion during the carefully crafted, heartrending scenes in certain movies? Because mirror neurons in our brains re-create for us the distress we see on the screen. We have empathy for the fictional characters&#x2014;we know how they&#x2019;re feeling&#x2014;because we literally experience the same feelings ourselves. And when we watch the movie stars kiss on-screen? Some of the cells firing in our brain are the same ones that fire when we kiss our lovers. &#x201c;Vicarious&#x201d; is not a strong enough word to describe the effect of these mirror neurons. When we see someone else suffering or in pain, mirror neurons help us to read her or his facial expression and actually make us feel the suffering or the pain of the other person. These moments, I will argue, are the foundation of empathy and possibly of morality, a morality that is deeply rooted in our biology. Do you watch sports on television? If so, you must have noticed the many &#x201c;reaction shots&#x201d; in the stands: the fan frozen with anticipation, the fan ecstatic over the play. (This is especially true for baseball broadcasts, with all the downtime between pitches.) These shots are effective television because our mirror neurons make sure that by seeing these emotions, we share them. To see the athletes perform is to perform ourselves. Some of the same neurons that fire when we watch a player catch a ball also fire when we catch a ball ourselves. It is as if by watching, we are also playing the game. We understand the players&#x2019; actions because we have a template in our brains for that action, a template based on our own movements. Since different actions share similar movement properties and activate similar muscles, we don&#x2019;t have to be skilled players to &#x201c;mirror&#x201d; the athletes in our brain. The mirror neurons of a non-tennis-playing fan will fire when watching a pro smash an overhead, because the non-tennis-playing fan has certainly made other kinds of overhead movements with his arm throughout his life; the equivalent neurons of a fan such as me, who also plays the game, will obviously be activated much more strongly. And if I&#x2019;m watching Roger Federer, I bet my mirror neurons must be firing wildly, because I&#x2019;m a big Federer fan.<br>Mirror neurons undoubtedly provide, for the first time in history, a plausible neurophysiological explanation for complex forms of social cognition and interaction. By helping us recognize the actions of other people, mirror neurons also help us to recognize and understand the deepest motives behind those actions, the intentions of other individuals. The empirical study of intention has always been considered almost impossible, because intentions were deemed too &#x201c;mental&#x201d; to be studied with empirical tools. How do we even know that other people have mental states similar to our own? Philosophers have mulled over this &#x201c;problem of other minds&#x201d; for centuries, with very little progress. Now they have some real science to work with. Research on mirror neurons gives them and everyone interested in how we understand one another some remarkable food for thought.<br>Consider the teacup experiment I dreamed up some years back, which I&#x2019;ll discuss in considerable detail later. The test subjects are shown three video clips involving the same simple action: a hand grasping a teacup. In one, there is no context for the action, just the hand and the cup. In another, the subjects see a messy table, complete with cookie crumbs and dirty napkins&#x2014;the aftermath of a tea party, clearly. The third video shows a neatly organized tabletop, in apparent preparation for the tea party. In all three video clips, a hand reaches in to pick up the teacup. Nothing else happens, so the grasping action observed by the subjects in the experiment is exactly the same. The only difference is the context.<br>Do mirror neurons in the brains of our subjects note the difference in the contexts? Yes. When the subject is observing the grasping scene with no context at all, mirror neurons are the least active. They are more active when the subject is watching either of the scenes and most active when watching the neat scene. Why? Because drinking is a much more fundamental intention for us than is cleaning up. The teacup experiment is now well known in the field of neuroscience, but it is not an isolated result: solid empirical evidence suggests that our brains are capable of mirroring the deepest aspects of the minds of others&#x2014;intention is definitely one such aspect&#x2014;at the fine-grained level of a single brain cell. This is utterly remarkable. Equally remarkable is the effortlessness of this simulation. We do not have to draw complex inferences or run complicated algorithms. Instead, we use mirror neurons.<br>Looking at the issue from another perspective, labs around the world are accumulating evidence that social deficits, such as those associated with autism, may be due to a primary dysfunction of mirror neurons. I hypothesize that mirror neurons may also be very important in imitative violence induced by media violence, and we have preliminary evidence suggesting that mirror neurons are important in various forms of social identification, including &#x201c;branding&#x201d; and affiliation with a political party. Have you heard of neuroethics, neuromarketing, neuropolitics? You will in the years and decades to come, and research in these fields will be rooted, explicitly or otherwise, in the functions of mirror neurons.<br>This book tells the story of the serendipitous and groundbreaking discovery of this special class of brain cells, the remarkable advances in the field in just twenty years, and the extremely clever experiments now under way in several labs around the world. Quite simply, I believe this work will force us to rethink radically the deepest aspects of our social relations and our very selves. Some years ago, another researcher suggested that the discovery of mirror neurons promised to do for neuroscience what the discovery of DNA did for biology.1 That&#x2019;s an extraordinarily bold statement, because essentially everything in biology comes back to DNA. Decades in the future, will everything in neuroscience be seen as coming back to mirror neurons?&nbsp;<br>BRAIN SURPRISES<br>For fifteen years I have lived in Los Angeles and worked in my laboratory at UCLA, but as my name suggests, this story should rightly begin in Italy, and I&#x2019;m happy to report that it really does&#x2014;specifically, in the small and beautiful city of Parma, famous for its fabulous food, particularly prosciutto di Parma and Parmesan cheese, and for its music. Now we can add neuroscience to the list of Parma&#x2019;s world-class exports; it was at the university here that a group of neurophysiologists, led by my friend Giacomo Rizzolatti, first identified mirror neurons.<br>Rizzolatti and his colleagues work with Macaca nemestrina, a species of monkey often used in neuroscience labs worldwide. These macaque monkeys are very docile animals, unlike their more famous relatives, rhesus monkeys, who are highly competitive alpha-male types (even the females). Research on monkeys in a lab such as Rizzolatti&#x2019;s is predicated on its inferential value for understanding the human brain, which is generally considered the most complex entity in the known universe, with good reason. The human brain contains about one hundred billion neurons, each of which can make contact with thousands, even tens of thousands, of other neurons. These contacts, or synapses, are the means by which neurons communicate with one another, and their number is staggering. The distinguishing brain feature in mammals is the neocortex, the most recently evolved of our brain structures. Now here&#x2019;s the key &#x201c;inferential&#x201d; point: the macaque brain is only about one-fourth as large as ours, and our neocortex is much larger than the macaque&#x2019;s neocortex, but neuroanato-mists typically agree that the structures in the neocortex of macaques and humans correspond relatively well despite these differences.<br>In Parma, the Rizzolatti team&#x2019;s pertinent area of study was an area of the brain labeled F5, located in a large region called the premotor cortex&#x2014;that part of the neocortex concerned with planning, selecting, and executing actions. Area F5 contains millions of neurons that specialize in &#x201c;coding&#x201d; for one specific motor behavior: actions of the hand, including grasping, holding, tearing, and, most fundamental of all, bringing objects&#x2014;food&#x2014;to the mouth. For every macaque, as for every primate, these actions are as basic and essential as they come. We Homo sapiens are grasping and manipulating objects from the moment we fumble for the snooze button on the alarm clock until we adjust our pillows at bedtime, eighteen hours later. All in all, we each perform hundreds, if not thousands, of grasping actions every day. In fact, this is precisely why the Rizzolatti team chose area F5 for the closest possible investigation. All neuroscientists want to understand the brain for understanding&#x2019;s sake, but we also have an eye on more practical goals, such as discoveries that may eventually drive new treatments for disease. The discovery of the neurophysiological mechanisms of motor control of the hand in the macaque could eventually help individual humans with brain damage recover at least some degree of hand function.<br>Through laborious experimentation, the Rizzolatti team had acquired an impressive understanding of the actions of these motor cells during various &#x201c;grasping&#x201d; exercises with the monkeys. (They are called motor cells because they are the first in the sequence that controls the muscles that move the body.) Then one day, about twenty years ago, the neurophysiologist Vittorio Gallese was moving around the lab during a lull in the day&#x2019;s experiment. A monkey was sitting quietly in the chair, waiting for her next assignment. Sud-denly, just as Vittorio reached for something&#x2014;he does not remember what&#x2014;he heard a burst of activity from the computer that was connected to the electrodes that had been surgically implanted in the monkey&#x2019;s brain. To the inexperienced ear, this activity would have sounded like static; to the ear of an expert neuroscientist, it signaled a discharge from the pertinent cell in area F5. Vittorio immediately thought the reaction was strange. The monkey was just sitting quietly, not intending to grasp anything, yet this neuron affiliated with the grasping action had fired nevertheless.<br>Or so goes one story about the first recorded observation of a mirror neuron. Another involves one of Vittorio&#x2019;s colleagues, Leo Fogassi, who picked up a peanut and triggered an excited response in F5. Yet another credits Vittorio Gallese and some ice cream. There are others, all plausible, none confirmed. Years later, when the importance of mirror neurons was clearly understood, the Parma colleagues went back to their lab notes, hoping to put together a fairly accurate timeline of their earliest observations, but they simply couldn&#x2019;t do it. They found references in their lab notes to &#x201c;complex visual responses&#x201d; of the monkeys&#x2019; motor cells in area F5. Such notes were unclear, because the scientists did not know what to make of their observations at the time. Neither they nor any neuroscientist in the world could have imagined that motor cells could fire merely at the perception of somebody else&#x2019;s actions, with no motor action involved at all. In light of both knowledge and theory at the time, this made absolutely no sense. Cells in the monkey brain that send signals to other cells that are anatomically connected to muscles have no business firing when the monkey is completely still, hands in lap, watching somebody else&#x2019;s actions. And yet they did.<br>In the end, it does not matter much that the &#x201c;Eureka!&#x201d; moment for mirror neurons stretched over a period of years. What matters is that the team did soon grapple with the odd goings-on in their laboratory. They had a hard time believing these phenomena themselves, but in time they also sensed that the discovery, if confirmed, could be potentially groundbreaking. They were right. Twenty years after that first recording in the laboratory, a cascade of well-controlled experiments with monkeys and later with humans (different kinds of experiments, for the most part; no needles inserted through skulls) have confirmed the remarkable phenomenon. The simple fact that a subset of the cells in our brains&#x2014;the mirror neurons&#x2014;fire when an individual kicks a soccer ball, sees a ball being kicked, hears a ball being kicked, and even just says or hears the word &#x201c;kick&#x201d; leads to amazing consequences and new understandings.&nbsp;<br>Excerpted from Mirroring People by Marco Iacoboni.

A widower with a small child and a busy medical career needed someone to make sure his domestic life ran smoothly. What she hadn&#39;t counted on was his decision to offer her the position. As his wife, she would have a comfortable lifestyle and everything that money could buy. But what was that, if Gijs couldn&#39;t offer her love?</p><p>Romance readers around the world were sad to note the passing of Betty Neels in June 2001.Her career spanned thirty years, and she continued to write into her ninetieth year.To her millions of fans, Betty epitomized the romance writer.Betty&#x2019;s first book, Sister Peters in Amsterdam,was published in 1969, and she eventually completed 134 books.Her novels offer a reassuring warmth that was very much a part of her own personality.Her spirit and genuine talent live on in all her stories.Lady Dowley's Christmas party was in full swing, an event which achieved the very pinnacle of social life in the village of Little Estling, remotely situated as it was some nine miles from Aylesbury and well away from the main road. Remote though it was, it had more than its fair share of landed gentry and the retired professional classes scattered in and around the small place, carrying on tradition: cricket in summer, garden parties, church bazaars, carol-singing at Christmas...<br><br>The large ornate drawing-room in Lady Dowley's Victorian mansion was full of people, not because she was especially liked in the neighbourhood but because she offered refreshments of a kind most of them were quite unable to afford: smoked salmon, Parma ham, delicious bits and pieces poised on minuscule scraps of toast. The wines were good too; her late husband had assembled a nice cellar before he died. She was an overbearing woman, still handsome in a middle-aged way and prone to interfere in other people's affairs and with a deep-rooted conviction that she was always right. It would have upset her very much to know that her friends and acquaintances pitied her and, despite not liking her over-much, would be prepared to go to her aid if it should ever be required.<br><br>Happily unaware of this, she surged to and fro, being gracious to those she considered a little beneath her socially and effusive to those she saw as her equals, and presently she fetched up before a middle-aged, thick-set man with a calm wise face and shrewd eyes.<br><br>'Dr Crawley, how delightful to see you.' She glanced around her. 'And your dear wife?' She didn't give him time to answer. 'And your lovely daughter?'<br><br>Dr Crawley said comfortably, 'They are here, Lady Dowley, no doubt having a good gossip with someone or other. You're keeping well? And Phoebe?'<br><br>'I told her that she simply had to come&#x2014;I go to all the trouble of asking any number of interesting people.' She looked over his shoulder. 'You must excuse me; there is a very old firm friend&#x2014;do remember me to your wife if I shouldn't see her... Perhaps she will come to tea soon.'<br><br>Dr Crawley made a non-committal noise. His wife, a sweet-tempered woman with a retiring disposition, was none the less the granddaughter of an earl, therefore to be cultivated by his hostess. Dr Crawley, whose family had lived on the outskirts of the village for generations, and who knew every single inhabitant, gave a derisive snort and then turned to see who was tapping him on the shoulder.<br><br>His daughter Beatrice was a head taller than he, a splendidly shaped girl standing five feet ten inches tall in her bare feet and as pretty as a picture. She had light brown hair, long and straight and coiled in the nape of her neck, large grey eyes with sweeping lashes the same colour as her hair, a delicate nose and a wide, sweetly curved mouth above a determined chin. She was smiling.<br><br>'Father, cheer up&#x2014;we'll be able to leave in another half-hour or so. I've left Mother with Mrs Hodge discussing knitting patterns.' She stopped abruptly as a pair of hands covered her eyes from behind. 'Derek, it is you, isn't it? Has the path. lab thrown you out at last?'<br><br>She put up a hand to her forehead. 'Don't you dare to make my hair untidy, it took me hours...!'<br><br>The hands dropped and she was turned round, smiling, offering a cheek for his casual kiss, aware that there was someone with him. A man of vast proportions with grey hair cut very short and heavy-lidded blue eyes. It was an unpleasant shock to see that he was looking at her with a detached coolness so that her smile faded. He doesn't like me, she thought uncertainly, but we don't even know each other.<br><br>'Beatrice, this is Gijs van der Eekerk&#x2014;Gijs, this is Beatrice Crawley; we've known each other since we were trundled out in our prams. Years ago.'<br><br>She shot him a look&#x2014;any minute now he would tell this man how old she was. She held out a hand and said, 'How do you do?' and had it engulfed in a firm grip. 'Are you visiting Derek?' she asked, wanting to hear his voice.<br><br>'For a day or so.' He stood, looking down at her, making no effort to hold the kind of social conversation she expected.<br><br>'You're Dutch?' she asked for the sake of something to say. 'You know England well?'<br><br>'I come over fairly frequently&#x2014;this is a very pretty part of the country.'<br><br>She agreed and wished heartily that Derek and her father would stop whatever they were saying to each other and help out with the talk.<br><br>'What a pity it is that convention prevents us from saying what we wish to say and forces us to make small talk about the weather.'<br><br>He had a deep voice and his English was faultless with only a slight accent. She stared at him, at a loss for words for a moment. Then she said, 'That wouldn't do at all.' She spoke sharply. 'But I think you would like to.'<br><br>He smiled then, a small smile which made her feel foolish although she had no idea why. 'Indeed I would, and I must warn you that at times I do.' He paused. 'Speak my mind.'<br><br>'Then I am sorry for whoever has to listen to you,' she said with a snap. 'You'll excuse me? I see someone I want to talk to.'<br><br>She left him and he watched her go before joining her father and his friend.<br><br>She knew everyone there, going from group to group, exchanging gossip, and all the while knowing that she would have to find the wretched man and apologise for her rudeness. All the same, she reminded herself, she had meant it.<br><br>Her mother and father were on the point of leaving when she saw him again, talking to the Reverend Mr Perkins. She made her way slowly towards them, intent on getting the business over since they weren't likely to meet again.<br><br>The rector saw her first. 'Beatrice&#x2014;I've been wanting a word with you&#x2014;come over to the rectory in the morning, will you.?' He looked apologetically at the man beside him. 'Christmas, you know&#x2014;such a busy time.' He held out a hand. 'A pleasure meeting you, and I hope it may be repeated.' He beamed at Beatrice. 'I leave you in good hands; Beatrice is a sweet girl.' He trotted off, unaware of the effect of his words.<br><br>Her companion lifted his eyebrows. 'I'm delighted to hear that,' he said pleasantly, 'and, I must admit, surprised.'<br><br>Beatrice's magnificent bosom swelled with sudden temper. 'I might have known,' she said bitterly. 'I came to apologise for being rude, but I'm not going to now.'<br><br>He said to infuriate her still more, 'No, no, why should you? You have a very good expression in English&#x2014;to vent one's spleen&#x2014;so very apt, I have always thought. Besides, bad temper suits you. Pray don't give a thought to apologising.'<br><br>'Well, I won't. It is a very good thing that we are never likely to see each other again, for we don't get on.'<br><br>'Apparently not.' He sounded uninterested, waiting for her to end the conversation.<br><br>'Goodbye,' said Beatrice. If she had known how to flounce she would have done so, but she didn't, so she walked away with her chin up and a very straight back. She looked just as delightful from the back, the man reflected, watching her go.<br><br>Beatrice, sitting beside her father as he drove home through the scattering of houses and up the hill on the other side to where they lived, replied rather absent-mindedly to her mother's comments about the party, while she reflected, very much to her surprise, that she wished that she could meet Gijs van der Eekerk again. Not because she liked him, she hastened to assure herself, but to find out more about him.<br><br>Her mother's voice interrupted her thoughts. 'Will you see Tom tomorrow?'<br><br>'Tom?' Beatrice sounded vague, 'Oh, I don't know...'<br><br>Mrs Crawley's maternal instincts were at once on the alert. 'What a charming man that was who came with Derek&#x2014;I wonder where he comes from and what he does.?'<br><br>Beatrice muttered, 'I've no idea,' and her father made no effort to enlighten them; instead he made some placid remark about the evening.<br><br>Christmas was only two days away. George, the Crawleys' son, a medical student nine years younger than his sister, would be coming home for two days' leave and two elderly aunts would be arriving in the morning to spend Christmas&#x2014;there was more than enough to keep Beatrice busy what with helping her mother prepare for Christmas and helping with the flowers at the church. Making mince pies and arranging holly wreaths made a welcome change from her job at St Justin's Hospital in the heart of the East End of London. She liked her work&#x2014;being responsible for the smooth running and maintainance of the extensive laboratory attached to the hospital. She had gone there straight from her domestic science course and gradually worked her way up to her present job&#x2014;as high as she could go. Sometimes the thought that she would be there for ever crept into her mind&#x2014;twenty-eight was no longer the first flush of youth and despite several offers of marriage she had felt no urge to accept any of them. There was always Tom, of course, who tended to behave as though he had only to beckon and she would come. He was ambitious, working his way ruthlessly to a consultant's status, and she sometimes suspected that the love he professed for her was a good deal less than his anticipation of a path smoothed for him by a father-in-law who knew all the right people. He was a pleasant companion and she saw a good deal of him&#x2014;had even invited him home for a weekend. Her mother and father had been hospitable and friendly but she was aware that they hadn't liked him.<br><br>George arrived soon after breakfast on Christmas Eve, laden with a bag of washing, a crate of beer and a great many parcels. 'Presents,' he explained cheerfully, 'but I've not had time to wrap them up&#x2014;I know you'll do it for me, Beatrice.'<br><br>'I'll be sorry for your wife when you get one,' said Beatrice good-naturedly and filled the washing-machine before going in search of paper and labels. He sat at the kitchen table drinking mugs of coffee and telling her what to write on the labels in between answering his mother's questions about his work. He was just starting his second year and had passed his first exams; he loved it, he assured her, and Beatrice, who had a very good idea of a medical student's life, smiled at him. They got on well together despite the difference in their ages and, perhaps because of this, he had always confided in her.<br><br>She finished the presents, cut him a hunk of the big fruitcake on the dresser and went to answer the doorbell.<br><br>It was the aunts, elderly and rather old-fashioned, having been driven from Aylesbury in a hired car. They were sitting in the back, very erect, their faces composed under formidable felt hats. Beatrice greeted them and the chauffeur, asked him to bring in the luggage and went to help her aunts out of the car. They were both quite capable of helping themselves but it never entered their heads to do so. They never spoke of the lordly head of the family but they didn't forget him either. Certain standards had to be maintained; they reminded each other of this from time to time and they had no intention of altering a way of life which had been normal in their youth, but despite their stiff manners they were dear old things&#x2014;Beatrice loved them.<br><br>She eased them out carefully, kissed the proffered cheeks and led the way indoors.<br><br>Later that morning, the old ladies settled in and the chores done, Beatrice got into the elderly cloak hanging behind the kitchen door and worn by everyone in the family and took herself off to the church to find Mr Perkins. He was putting a plug on the fairy-lights on the Christmas tree and making a bad job of it. Beatrice took it from him, rearranged the wires, screwed them down and handed it back to him. He was a nice old man, everyone in the village liked him, but he needed a great deal of looking after since his wife had died.<br><br>He thanked her warmly. 'I asked you to come and see me but I'm afraid I can't remember why.' And before she could suggest anything, he said, 'What a very nice man that was with young Derek&#x2014;I wish I had had more time to talk to him. I trust we shall see him again.'<br><br>'Well, I shouldn't think so,' said Beatrice. 'He's Dutch, you know, and only here on a visit.'<br><br>'A pity. Ah, I've remembered what I wished to ask you, my dear. If you could give a hand with the children during the blessing of the crib?'<br><br>'Yes, of course. Six o'clock this evening, isn't it?'<br><br>'So kind. When do you go back to your work, Beatrice?'<br><br>'Boxing Day, in the evening. It's lovely to be home for Christmas. I must fly&#x2014;the aunts and George are staying with us, and Mother needs a hand in the kitchen.'<br><br>'Yes, yes, of course.' He smiled gently. 'Run along...<br><br>It seems only the other day that you were a little girl. How old are you now, Beatrice?' 'Twenty-eight.'<br><br>'You should be married with children.'<br><br>'As soon as I can find a husband I'll do just that, and you shall marry us.' She laughed as she spoke, but really, she reflected as she sped home, it was no laughing matter. She hadn't lacked for prospective husbands but somehow none of them had touched her heart. 'I dare say I shall make a splendid aunt,' she said to Horace, the elderly cat who had invited himself to live with them some years ago and had been there ever since.<br><br>Horace jumped down off the wall and followed her into the house. He had long ago realised that when she was at home he could be sure of getting his meals on time. Her romantic future was of no concern to him.<br><br>She hadn't been home for Christmas for three years and she enjoyed every moment of it, especially the blessing of the crib with the children milling around, some of them dressed in curtains and their mothers' dressing-gowns and gold paper crowns, enacting their own little play round the crib. Beatrice, nipping smartly to and fro, shushing the noisiest of them and rearranging the curtains which had come adrift, thoroughly enjoyed herself. She went home to supper when it was all over and listened to her aunts' gentle reminiscences of their youth and presently slipped out of the room to join George and listen to his account of his life at the hospital. She gathered that it wasn't bad&#x2014;he was clever and when he chose worked hard and didn't mind the long hours of study. He had friends too, and his social life, as far as she could gather, was a lively one.<br><br>'What about you?' he wanted to know. 'Isn't it about time you got married?' He added, 'What about Tom?'</p><h2>Quiet Water Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island, 2nd: Canoe and Kayak Guide (AMC Quiet Water Series)</h2><p>Now completely revised and updated, with a new format that&#39;s easier to use, Quiet Water Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island describes 100 spectacular paddling destinations in southern New England.</p><p>This updated and expanded edition of AMC&#39;s popular Quiet Water guide offers paddlers of all ages and abilities adventure and enjoyment on the water.

Indeed, after 1916, the number of spiritualist societies in the United Kingdom almost doubled, from 158 to 309. As Arthur Conan Doyle explained, &#39;The deaths occurring in almost every family in the land brought a sudden and concentrated interest in the life after death. People not only asked the question, &#34;If a man die, shall he live again?&#34; but they eagerly sought to know if communication was possible with the dear ones they had lost.&#39; From the Angel of Mons to the popular boom in spiritualism as the horrors of industrialised warfare reaped their terrible harvest, the paranormal - and its use in propaganda - was one of the key aspects of the First World War. Angels in the Trenches takes us from defining moments, such as the Angel of Mons on the Front Line, to spirit communication on the Home Front, often involving the great and the good of the period, such as aristocrat Dame Edith Lyttelton, founder of the War Refugees Committee, and the physicist Sir Oliver Lodge, Principal of Birmingham University. We see here people at every level of society struggling to come to terms with the ferocity and terror of the war, and their own losses: soldiers looking for miracles on the battlefield; parents searching for lost sons in the seance room. It is a human story of people forced to look beyond the apparent certainties of the everyday - and this book follows them on that journey.</p><p><b>Dr LEO RUICKBIE</b>, PhD (Lond), MA, BA (Hons), Associate of King's College, is a professional writer, editor, social scientist and historian, specialising in controversial areas of human belief and experience. <br>His PhD is from King's College, London, for his thesis on contemporary witchcraft and magic use, building on research on the theory of re-enchantment that won him an MA with distinction from Lancaster University.

Grief-stricken, the community mourned what they thought was an isolated loss. Until, a few weeks later, it happened again. And again. And again. In six months, the high school lost five students to suicide at those train tracks. </p><p>A recent transplant to the community and a new father himself, Lee Daniel Kravetz&#x2019;s experience as a science journalist kicked in: what was causing this tragedy? More important, how was it possible that a suicide cluster could develop in a community of concerned, aware, hyper-vigilant adults? </p><p>The answer? Social contagion. We all know that ideas, emotions, and actions are communicable&#x2014;from mirroring someone&#x2019;s posture to mimicking their speech patterns, we are all driven by unconscious motivations triggered by our environment. But when just the right physiological, psychological, and social factors come together, we get what Kravetz calls a "strange contagion:" a perfect storm of highly common social viruses that, combined, form a highly volatile condition.</p><p><em>Strange Contagion</em> is simultaneously a moving account of one community&#x2019;s tragedy and a rigorous investigation of social phenomenon, as Kravetz draws on research and insights from experts worldwide to unlock the mystery of how ideas spread, why they take hold, and offer thoughts on our responsibility to one another as citizens of a globally and perpetually connected world. </p></p><p><p>Lee Daniel Kravetz has a master's degree in counseling psychology and is a graduate of the University of Missouri&#x2013;Columbia School of Journalism.

From there, he connects core ideas of Buddhist philosophy to the truths of our shared condition. His Holiness delivers a sparklingly clear teaching on how the Buddhist ideas of emptiness and interdependency relate to personal experience and bring a deeper understanding of the world around us.<br><br>In down-to-earth style, this book sets forth a comprehensive explanation of the foundational teachings of the Mahayana tradition based on the works of two of Buddhism's most revered figures. Using Nagarjuna's <i>Middle Way</i>, the Dalai Lama explores Buddhist understandings of selflessness, dependent origination, and the causal processes that lock us in cycles of suffering. He grounds these heady philosophical discussions using Tsongkhapa's <i>Three Principal Aspects of the Path</i>, presenting a brief explanation of how to put ethical discipline, wisdom, and compassion into practice.<br><br>Through these beautifully complementary teachings, His Holiness urges us to strive, "with an objective mind, endowed with a curious skepticism, to engage in careful analysis and seek the reasons behind our beliefs."</p><p>Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, is the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people. Born in northeastern Tibet in 1935, he was as a toddler recognized as the incarnation of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama and brought to Tibet's capital, Lhasa. In 1950, Mao Zedong's Communist forces made their first incursions into eastern Tibet, shortly after which the young Dalai Lama assumed the political leadership of his country. In 1959, Chinese forces occupied the city, forcing His Holiness to escape to India. There he set up the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala, working to secure the welfare of the more than 100,000 Tibetan exiles and prevent the destruction of Tibetan culture. In his capacity as a spiritual and political leader, he has traveled to more than sixty-two countries on six continents and met with presidents, popes, and leading scientists to foster dialogue and create a better world. In recognition of his tireless work for the nonviolent liberation of Tibet, the Dalai Lama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. In 2012, he relinquished political authority in his exile government and turned it over to democratically elected representatives. He is the author of numerous books, including <i>The Good Heart</i>, <i>The Meaning of Life</i>, <i>The World of Tibetan Buddhism</i>, and <i>The Compassionate Life</i>.<br><br>Thupten Jinpa Langri was educated in the classical Tibetan monastic academia and received the highest academic degree of Geshe Lharam (equivalent to a doctorate in divinity). Jinpa also holds a BA in philosophy and a PhD in religious studies, both from the University of Cambridge, England. Since 1985, he has been the principal English-language translator to the Dalai Lama. He has translated and edited many books by the Dalai Lama, including<i> The World of Tibetan Buddhism</i>, <i>Essence of the Heart Sutra</i>, and <i>Ethics for the New</i> <i>Millennium</i>. Jinpa has published scholarly articles on various aspects of Tibetan culture, Buddhism, and philosophy, and books such as <i>Songs of Spiritual Experience</i> (co-authored) and <i>Self, Reality and Reason in Tibetan </i>Thought. He serves on the advisory board of numerous educational and cultural organizations in North America, Europe, and India. He is currently the president and the editor-in-chief of the Institute of Tibetan Classics, a nonprofit educational organization dedicated to translating key Tibetan classics into contemporary languages.

Thank you again for being willing to pause this interview so I could take care of certain shipboard details. We&#x2019;re getting close to bringing everything up to date, though, so I trust you&#x2019;ll find this last leg worth the wait. And I thank you for allowing me to address everything chronologically, since I know some of what&#x2019;s coming up contains some of the biggest questions people have held about me, my plans, and, well, everything. At least this way, you and your viewers will have a reasonably solid understanding of everything that led up to these things.<br><br>Now, if I remember correctly, we&#x2019;d reached the point where I had destroyed my previous ship, the TUPSF Hellfire, to keep it out of enemy hands&#x2014;which enemy? The Feyori, of course. The undergalaxy isn&#x2019;t my concern. There&#x2019;s no way a Salik or a Choya or even a Grey could get onto my ship without my permission, let alone a Human impostor . . . but the Meddlers are another matter. Unfortunately, there was only one way to keep the Hellfire out of their hands and, at the same time, force them into faction with me&#x2014;and yes, I had the Admiral-General&#x2019;s permission. Extremely reluctant permission, but it wasn&#x2019;t as if I could pilot two starships at once, so Hellfire had to make way for Damnation . . . which is ironically apropos, given the hardship that followed.<br><br>I can&#x2019;t go into all the details of that incident, since most of it is still classified, but I can pick up the thread with my arrival on Dabin&#x2014;if you&#x2019;ve never been to Dabin and can tolerate the gravity, I can recommend going there for a vacation once the war ends. Gorgeous world, even if it&#x2019;s still recovering. I can honestly say I would love to go there again, once the war is over . . . Actually, a lot of places are like that.<br><br>But that&#x2019;s a thought for the future, and we&#x2019;re here to talk about the past, aren&#x2019;t we?<br><br>~Ia<br><br>JUNE 3, 2498 TERRAN STANDARD<br><br>OUTSKIRTS OF ELTEGAR CITY<br><br>JOINT COLONYWORLD DABIN, DABINAE SYSTEM<br><br>Three silvery, interclinging soap bubbles slipped their way down past the ugly, ceristeel-coated Salik vessels in orbit. Descending through the layers of Dabin&#x2019;s atmosphere, they ignored the heat of reentry because there was no matter for the air to rub against for the necessary friction. A slight course correction brought them down through the night toward a particular scattering of lights; otherwise, their descent was steady.<br><br>At the edge of those lights, they swerved again, detouring toward the hydroplant powering the town. Drifting to a stop just in front of the step-down station, the silvery soap bubbles dipped down into the faintly humming cables. The town lights in the distance dimmed slightly, then blinked out for a few seconds.<br><br>All three surfaces darkened until one of the bubbles popped. The lights in the distance flicked back on. A new figure dropped toward the ground, falling from the middle position. At nearly twice Terran Standard Gravity, the pull of the planet made the female Human drop fast . . . except she slowed at the last moment. Telekinesis cushioned her landing, burning off the excess energy left over from her transformation.<br><br>Ia touched down with a sigh. The gravity was the same one she and her crew had slowly gotten used to over the last two years, though not nearly as strong as the pull of the planet she&#x2019;d grown up on. Raking her chin-length white locks back from her face, she looked up at the other two bubbles, who were now merely sipping on the energies contained in the power lines overhead.<br><br>She still wore the same rumpled clothing from just a few days before: gray shirt and slacks with black stripes down the legs and sleeves; gray underthings and black ship boots; a gray plexi officer&#x2019;s bracer clasped over her shirtsleeve on her left forearm; and a crystalline bracer tucked under the sleeve of her right arm, its faint glow barely visible at the cuff opening. Her companions still looked like two dark, silvery soap bubbles roughly half the size of hovercars.<br><br>(Thank you for the lift,) she sent telepathically. It wasn&#x2019;t a strong psychic gift&#x2014;one of her weakest, in fact&#x2014;but she managed to make herself heard. Not that they couldn&#x2019;t have read her mind directly, but that wouldn&#x2019;t be polite . . . and they were now more or less equals. Or rather, she was now a fellow Player in the Feyori&#x2019;s great Game. (I&#x2019;m still not very good at that whole interstellar-travel thing, and I won&#x2019;t get a lot of chances to practice anytime soon.)<br><br>(The principle is the exact same as your faster-than-light technology: projecting a field of energy that neutralizes the Higgs Field, a bubble that &#x201c;greases&#x201d; you through space, and make one side slippery enough to squirt you past the speed of light,) Belini replied. She was the silvery soap bubble on the left. (You just haven&#x2019;t learned yet how to regurgitate and reshape your food on demand. It&#x2019;s all about projectile vomiting,) she giggled mentally.<br><br>Ia rolled her eyes. Belini had a strange sense of humor at times. (Like I said, I won&#x2019;t get a chance to practice much, so thank you for the lift. But it was worth it,) Ia added. (I&#x2019;m glad so many of you were swayed to my cause.)<br><br>(I don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;ve convinced all of &#x2019;em, kid,) Kierfando warned her. He was the soap bubble on her right as she looked up at the two aliens. (Not one hundred percent.)<br><br>(I know I haven&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;ll be an uphill struggle to get enough of your people on my side in time to do the most good,) Ia agreed. (But they&#x2019;ll see how determined I am to help them when they do faction with me, now that they&#x2019;re all watching me.)<br><br>(I know Miklinn will be furious when he finds out. He will continue to counterfaction you,) Belini warned Ia. (A pity you didn&#x2019;t pull him in. But you did pull in and receive ten times the quorum you needed for formal recognition, so you&#x2019;re not the least-ranked among us . . . which is bound to upset a few of the others. Hopefully, they&#x2019;ll be smart enough to faction with you.) A touch of smugness colored her sending. (As for myself, I&#x2019;ve just made up all the ground you made me lose, and plenty more. I&#x2019;m now almost three times higher-ranked than I was before.)<br><br>(I told you I&#x2019;d repay your faith in me,) Ia told the sphere on the left, giving her sponsor a brief, theatrical bow.<br><br>She shifted her attention back to the one on her right. To her Human eyes, they looked the same, virtually identical silvery soap bubbles. To her inner senses, they were distinct individuals. To the needs of the future . . . well, their species tried to make the matter-based races their pawns. Ia had to use them the same way. At least her reasons and needs were aimed for the good of all and not some sort of Game-based whim.<br><br>(Thank you for your help and support, Kierfando,) she told him, though &#x201c;he&#x201d; was only a male by choice in this era. His long-lived species didn&#x2019;t exactly correspond to Human analogs in their native state. (You&#x2019;d better get back to V&#x2019;Dan, though. You have a couple of the younger ones jockeying for power in your absence. Both of you need to get going within two minutes, or you&#x2019;ll lose momentum back in your home territories.)<br><br>(You&#x2019;ll be fine out here?) he asked her, sounding a bit like a fond uncle fussing over his niece. In the sense that her father was a fellow Feyori, he probably was. (We could move you closer if you like, but all of us needed a good meal, first.)<br><br>Ia shook her head. (I&#x2019;ll be fine. I&#x2019;m about to call up my Company and let them know I&#x2019;ve arrived. They&#x2019;ll make sure I get to where I need to go in time to start doing some good.) Something cold and wet smacked into the tip of her nose. Squinting, Ia looked up, then sighed as another droplet hit her chin and her cheek. A fourth stung her forehead. She wrinkled her nose. (Lovely, it&#x2019;s starting to rain. Lucky you. Energy beings aren&#x2019;t affected by things like rain, unlike us matter-based ones. Well, maybe by the thermal chill of the water . . .)<br><br>(That&#x2019;s because you limit yourself to matter-based concerns,) Kier sent, a mild scolding and a dry quip rolled into one. (You have a very compelling reason from a matter-based perspective, but it&#x2019;s still a limiting one. We&#x2019;ll see you soon. Pluck our strings in the way I showed you if you wish to talk. But beware that we ourselves are not in faction to the Dabin contingent, on either side of the war. You will be hard-pressed to convince them without another massive squandering of energy.)<br><br>(Remember also that plucking our strings for a summoning costs energy as well, and stock up before you call again. You don&#x2019;t want to drain yourself. Starvation in a Feyori can be deadly if you don&#x2019;t conserve your reserves carefully,) Belini cautioned her. (At least we could come back to rescue you, this time. Do also take into account that we may be busy with our own concerns since we now have some serious realigning to do following your little shake-up. You&#x2019;re lucky I&#x2019;m inclined to think this&#x2019;ll be fun instead of a stellar-sized headache.) Sucking one last time on the power cables, she swirled and lifted into the sky.<br><br>Kier did the same, dipping into the electrical current before following her. (Take care, half-breed. As you fleshies put it, straddling the fence between two worlds may give you a foot in each world, but it also gives you a hell of a wedgie if you&#x2019;re not careful.)<br><br>Caught off guard by his quip, Ia chuckled. She watched for as long as she could detect movement in the sky as he left, following Belini up to where they could feast on the local solar winds for a bit more energy, then sighed. Alone in the late-evening drizzle, she flipped open the lid of her command unit.<br><br>The buttons of the interior had no symbols on them, in order to prevent outsiders from accessing their functions; instead, every soldier in the Terran Space Force had to memorize which rounded square did what. Punching in the contact codes for her second-in-command&#x2019;s unit, Ia started walking toward the town.<br><br>It took him twenty seconds to answer. When he did, Meyun Harper&#x2019;s voice was both startled and relieved. And sleepy-sounding. &#x201c;&#x2014;Captain? Ia, is that you? I, uh . . . time, time . . . You&#x2019;re almost half a day late!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And a good evening to you, too,&#x201d; Ia replied, smiling. &#x201c;Turns out I didn&#x2019;t have a knack for mastering the trick of interstellar flight without a ship. I had to get a lift from some friends. Any chance you could send me some matter-based transport? All I have at the moment are my clothes, ship boots, and arm unit.&#x201d;<br><br>She heard a fumbling sound, followed by a loud clatter and a crude epithet. &#x201c;&#x2014;Sorry, dropped the arm unit. Uh . . . ground car, we can do. I think. The Army hasn&#x2019;t been entirely cooperative about our presence here, mostly because of the higher-ups. Captain Roghetti has been fairly good about it. But it&#x2019;ll take time. Unless you can come up with something better I can commandeer?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am aware of the difficulties of our situation, Commander,&#x201d; Ia admitted. &#x201c;Give me a moment to check the timestreams.&#x201d;<br><br>Aside from the pattering of the rain and the crunching of her boots as she walked along the gravel-paved access road leading away from the substation, there was nothing but her voice and his to break the quiet of the night. Off in the far distance, small flashes of orange and reddish light lit up pockets of the horizon, a reminder that this colony world was busy battling a ruthless, hungry enemy. But that was dozens of kilometers away. Turning most of her attention inward, down and around, she flipped her attention onto the timeplains.<br><br>Telepathy wasn&#x2019;t her strongest psychic gift. Precognition was. The local timestreams were just that: a visualization of rivulets and creeks crossing a vast, grassy prairie. Each stream represented a life, and wherever they touched and crossed lay a nexus of interactions rich with possibilities and rife with probabilities.<br><br>Dabin&#x2014;or at least the local corner of this world&#x2014;was a particularly muddy world, both literally and temporally. There were many things the enemy could do to block them from leaving, and many things they could do to counteract their foe. But there were other enemies, too: arrogance, fear, and apathy among them. Those were doing their own work, clouding the waters, fogging the probabilities. Such factors weakened the overall war effort by eating away at the hearts of the men and women struggling to fight back a strong enemy presence on this heavy-gravitied world.<br><br>&#x201c;. . . Contact Lieutenant Frederich. He has a ground car that can come pick me up. Tell him we&#x2019;ll swing by the liquor store, my treat, so he can call it an official beer run if his commander asks,&#x201d; Ia added.<br><br>Meyun chuckled. &#x201c;This from a woman who doesn&#x2019;t drink.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Alcohol ruins my self-control faster than sex,&#x201d; she quipped back. &#x201c;But that doesn&#x2019;t mean I&#x2019;ll stop others from having fun.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sex and alcohol? Does this mean I get to call it a date when I come pick you up?&#x201d; he asked, humor still warming his tone.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll insist on driving the car himself,&#x201d; Ia warned her second-in-command. &#x201c;So unless you want the lieutenant to watch . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shakk that. But I will take a rain check.&#x201d;<br><br>Squinting up at the clouds as the droplets started coming down in greater numbers, Ia sighed. &#x201c;You would have to mention the &#x2018;R&#x2019; word . . . Bring a thermal blanket and some towels so I can dry off on the ride back. I&#x2019;ll keep my unit active, so you can trace my position. And don&#x2019;t dawdle, Commander.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aye aye, sir. Harper out.&#x201d;<br><br>Tapping the buttons that would keep a subchannel linked between their units, Ia closed the lid. She kept walking, not having anything better to do. Examining the timestreams as she headed west, Ia peered both upstream into the past as well as downstream into the future. Her stomach rumbled with hunger, threatening to distract her, and the rain only made her thirsty. Electricity from the town&#x2019;s power grid had fed her in her other form, but it did nothing for her as a matter-based Human.<br><br>Ia did her best to ignore those discomforts as there was nothing she could do about them just yet. She had bigger worries than where her next meal was coming from, or when. The Salik had landed here in force, and in person.<br><br>Nobody expected a race of flipper-footed aliens from a lightly gravitied planet to want to invade a heavyworld. But Dabin was a mostly warm, M-class planet without too many inimical native life-forms, and none of them sentient beyond the Humans who had claimed it. Dabin was ideal for most oxygen-breathing, carbon-based life-forms to colonize and inhabit once the gravity problem was overcome.<br><br>Normally, that took a couple generations of adaptation as people moved from one world to the next, increasing their gravitational endurance generation by generation. The Humans back on her own homeworld, Sanctuary, were still struggling to adapt to its exceptionally high gravity, but Humans had evolved as fairly sturdy creatures. Only the Solaricans and the K&#x2019;Kattans could match them. The K&#x2019;Kattans themselves were natural heavyworlders, evolved with a dual endo-exo skeletal system, but even they had to spend a few generations adapting to planets outside their comfort zone.<br><br>The Salik had done something similar via the gradually increasing tug of artificial gravity, slo...</p><h2>Profits in the Wilderness: Entrepreneurship and the Founding of New England Towns in the Seventeenth Century (Published by the Omohundro Institute of ... and the University of North Carolina Press)</h2><p>In examining the founding of New England towns during the seventeenth century, John Frederick Martin investigates an old subject with fresh insight. Whereas most historians emphasize communalism and absence of commerce in the seventeenth century, Martin demonstrates that colonists sought profits in town-founding, that town founders used business corporations to organize themselves into landholding bodies, and that multiple and absentee landholding was common.<br><br>In reviewing some sixty towns and the activities of one hundred town founders, Martin finds that many town residents were excluded from owning common lands and from voting. It was not until the end of the seventeenth century, when proprietors separated from towns, that town institutions emerged as fully public entities for the first time.<br><br>Martin's study will challenge historians to rethink not only social history but also the cultural history of early New England. Instead of taking sides in the long-standing debate between Puritan scholars and business historians, Martin identifies strains within Puritanism and the rest of the colonists' culture that both discouraged and encouraged land commerce, both supported and undermined communalism, both hindered and hastened development of the wilderness. Rather than portray colonists one-dimensionally, Martin analyzes how several different and competing ethics coexisted within a single, complex, and vibrant New England culture.<br><br></p><p>"Takes the lead in bringing the history of colonial New England and Puritan colonization back into the mainstream. It is bound to be controversial."--Karen O.

P. STACEY PRIZE (Best book in Canadian Military History) WINNER: 2008 DISTINGUISHED BOOK AWARD, SOCIETY OF COLONIAL WARS Ugly, gangling, and tormented by agonising illness, Major General James Wolfe was an unlikely hero. Yet in 1759, on the Plains of Abraham before Quebec, he won a battle with momentous consequences. Wolfe&#39;s victory, bought at the cost of his life, ensured that English, not French, would become the dominant language in North America. Ironically, by crippling French ambitions on this continent Wolfe paved the way for American independence from Britain. Already renowned for bold leadership, Wolfe&#39;s death at the very moment of victory at Quebec cemented his heroic status on both sides of the Atlantic. He became an icon of patriotic self-sacrifice, immortalised in epic paintings and verse. During the past half century, however, Wolfe&#39;s reputation has undergone sustained assault by revisionist historians who see him as a bloodthirsty and self-righteous mediocrity, famous for one singularly lucky - though crucial - victory. Was there more to James Wolfe than a celebrated death? Stephen Brumwell&#39;s internationally praised biography seeks to answer that question, drawing on extensive research to offer a boldly argued reassessment of a soldier whose short but dramatic life changed the course of world history.</p><p>Stephen Brumwell is the acclaimed author of Redcoats and White Devil.

He and Paul Jacobs have put together fresh versions of familiar tales; stories based on songs, family histories, and America's past; as well as entirely new tales created just for this book. Each section describes the origins of the stories and there are suggestions for retelling and personalizing the tales to turn them into family favorites for bedtime or family time. And in keeping with the theme that a story never really ends-in fact gets better and better each time it is told-the book concludes with some beginnings, story openers to get you going on the path to creating your own storytelling tradition. Pete Seeger, a Grammy Award winner as well as the recipient of the N.E.A.

He earned an M.F.A. from the University of Virginia. Paul's grandfather co-wrote a number of songs with Pete Seeger which led to Paul collaborating with Pete on <b>Pete Seeger's Storytelling Book</b>.</p>Claiming that America is becoming "a nation of spectators" blind to their own folklore, Seeger presents this earnest collection to catalyze our collective imagination and resuscitate the country's oral tradition. The 80-year-old singer/songwriter/activist smartly anticipates that his audience (modern, pressed-for-time parents) will be daunted, so he offers helpful, if commonsensical, advice: start with something familiar (folktales, the Bible, Shakespeare), do not worry about structure or length and be spontaneous. "What's important is to create an atmosphere of sharing," he rightly observes in the introduction. "Kids are more interested in you than the plot." With the help of freelance writer and poet DuBois Jacobs, Seeger recounts more than 25 of his favorite tales in their entiretyAsome from American history ("The Emancipation Proclamation"), others from late-19th- and early-20th-century rounds and lullabies ("Dick Whittington and His Cat"), as well as selections from Seeger's and his father's oeuvres ("The Intelligent Lightbulbs"). All of them resonate with the balladeer's worldly voice and, of course, have a moralAusually about the power of music or the importance of hard workAthat children will be able to grasp and apply to real life. In the case of stories based on traditional songs (e.g., "Sam, the Whaler" goes along with the 19th-century whaling song, "The Hudson Whalers"), Seeger has also reproduced a few bars of music. A nice touch is chapter six, the closing section, which consists solely of story beginnings that Seeger urges readers to build on.

What makes this book different is the author&#39;s naturalistic approach to painting. The resulting watercolors are botanically correct but also show the beauty of flowers in a very real way---the velvety quality of a petal, the delicate colors, the gloss of a leaf. In this book, Coral G. Guest talks about how best to achieve not only the colors but also the textures and shadings that are so important in painting flowers. She has chosen a wide variety of plants, and in a series of illustrations shows how---step by step---she has developed each painting. The result is a most inspirational and stunning guide for any artist wanting to make his or her paintings look more natural.</p><p>The watercolors created using this naturalistic approach are botanically correct but also show the beauty of flowers in a very real way-the velvety quality of a petal, the delicate colors, the gloss of a leaf.Coral G. Guest is an acclaimed flower painter whose work combines botanical authenticity with a highly appealing artistic style. Her classical training as a painter at Chelsea School of Art, London was followed by the practice of Zen Calligraphy at Seitai-Ji Temple in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan. She first embarked upon a series of flower pictures in the mid 1980s as part of her meditations on nature. She considers the study of plants to be a worthy subject for a contemporary painter, and has conducted her highly successful courses on naturalistic flower painting at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, for a number of years. She has received numerous awards (including two RHS Gold Medals), frequently lectures, and has written for various magazines. Her work is shown internationally, and is represented in many public and private collections, including the Royal Horticultural Society, Lindley Library; the Dr Shirley Sherwood Collection of Contemporary Botanical Art; and the Hunt Botanical Institute.</p><h2>Floating City</h2><p>Deep within the Vietnamese jungle lies Floating City, a secret empire run on riches and murder. At its heart is Rock, an American Vietnam vet -- a killing machine raised on war and rock-and-roll. Ruthless and bloodthirsty, he rules like a god supreme over his legendary dominion. And at his command is the Torch -- the tool of ultimate evil that only one man can destroy: Nicholas Linnear. <p> But to penetrate Floating City, Nicholas must first confront his own inner demons: the Yakuza, the Japanese criminal underworld he despises, and his own past. Only when he faces the harrowing truth about himself and about Koei, the woman he loved as no other, will Nicholas find the inner strength to carry out the two missions that have now become one: destroy Floating City, and honor his family's debt to the head of the Yakuza, the Kaisho. </p><p> While Linnear heads into the heart of a vast web of terror, half a world away his longtime friend, ex-NYPD Detective Lew Croaker, is hunting the Kaisho's would-be assassins. From the foul back alleys of Saigon to the forbidding jungles of Southeast Asia to the corridors of power in Tokyo and Washington, D.C., Linnear and Croaker cross the blood-red line that divides good from evil, sexuality from death, love from betrayal -- rushing inexorably toward an explosive climax that you will never forget.</p></p><p>Eric Lustbader is the author of nearly forty novels, including the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>The Ninja</i>, which introduced Nicholas Linnear, one of modern fiction&#x2019;s most beloved and enduring heroes. In 2004, Mr. Lustbader was chosen by the estate of the late Robert Ludlum to continue the Jason Bourne novels, and has published eight international bestselling works to rave reviews. He is also the author of two successful and highly regarded series of fantasy novels, <i>The Sunset Warrior Cycle</i> and <i>The Pearl Saga</i>. He and his wife Victoria are residents of the South Fork of Long Island.The world's a perilous place indeed, full of moral ambiguity and inscrutable Asian mystique, in Lustbader's (Black Blade, 1993, etc.) second installation of the Kaisho series. While piecing together clues of an international criminal bombing plot, Nicholas Linnear must locate Mikio Okami, the Japanese Mafia godfather he finds morally reprehensible but has sworn to his father to protect. Okami is in hiding because most of the other characters want him dead. His closest Japanese associates want to move past petty business profits and arms sales into drug trafficking. American mobster ``Bad Clams'' Leonforte has an unhealthy interest in tracking Okami, possibly because he is the adversary of Okami's former partner, the brutally murdered Dominic Goldoni, or because he is involved with Senator Dedalus, who coordinates illegal arms trades from a Washington, DC, strip joint. Linnear pursues the Asian connection and, while there, an old flame, while his pal Lew Croaker sleuths in the States, a job that includes tailing Goldoni's sister, Margarite, with whom, if that don't beat all, he's in love. Occasional telephone conversations between Linnear and Croaker recap their progress in tracing Okami and digging up the details on Torch, a powerful, portable nuclear weapon scheduled to detonate in some unspecified city. Until then, it is housed with its creator, a Russian cyberneticist and defector, in Floating City, the Vietnamese stronghold of Rock, an American veteran who had too much fun firing his missile launcher to ever leave Vietnam. While mingling with these politicians and gangsters, the heroes rely upon their unique resources: Linnear upon his tanjian--a psychic discipline that converts thought into action--and Croaker upon his biomechanical, titanium-sheathed left hand. Honorable bad guys and elaborate secrets mingle with the usual senseless violence and sensual, exploited Asian women. Whoever makes it to the end of this entangled thriller will find that the loose ends make the next Linnear installment a must-read. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Their many hopes and dreams for their new family are suddenly put in danger when a merciless winter storm hits. The logs in the woodpile quickly dwindle, and soon their only chance for survival is to cut down the lone remaining spruce tree, which provides warmth and shelter to a family of geese--a family not unlike their own. On Christmas Eve the couple prays for a miracle that will protect them and their newborn son. Thomas Locker's glorious paintings and Keith Strand's inspiring reverie bring the Christmas spirit to life in this heartwarming story of faith and family.<br></p><p>THOMAS LOCKER has written and illustrated many award-winning books for children, including the companion titles Water Dance and Mountain Dance. He lives in Stuyvesant, New York.Grade 1-3-A young man and his wife move to Colorado in the spring of 1886 and build a home in a remote area half a day's wagon ride from the nearest town. Severe blizzards in November and December force them to chop down some sheltering spruce trees to heat their frigid cabin. The two discover a pair of geese taking shelter under the lone remaining spruce and they agonize over whether to cut it down. Despite their troubles, the woman gives birth to a healthy baby boy, and the family manages to survive until the next big winter storm arrives. After a night of "hoping and praying for a miracle," they awaken on Christmas morning to find a change in the weather. Although the text reads smoothly, the couple's dire circumstances are repeatedly emphasized to the point that they bog down the narrative. Locker's characteristically beautiful oil landscapes and, in the nature scenes, breathtaking use of color draw readers' attention. Strand ties up his tale with a holiday tradition that commemorates that fateful winter, which may spark children to inquire about their own family customs.

It was a colonial war and a regional war. It was a total war and a limited war. It was a civil war, an insurgency and a conventional war - and indeed it varied from one form to another at different times and in different places. It was a war in mountains, jungles or open rice paddies depending on the location of the battlefield. It was a war of high technology and no technology. It was a war of airpower and a war of footpower. It was a helicopter war and a brown-water war. It was a war won on the battlefield and lost on the homefront. One thing that the Vietnam War was not was simply an American War. It was a war of varying and mutable contexts - a chameleon of constant change. The greatest American failure in the conflict was a failure to understand context. For far too many important American planners the Vietnam War had but one context - the black and white context of the Cold War; a context that begged an inexorable singular military logic and solution. A military solution that was so overly simple that it proved to be no solution at all. <br><br>���� The present study takes as its main goal to place the Vietnam War into its proper contexts. Though <i>Rolling Thunder in a Gentle Land</i> cannot pretend to answer all of the nagging questions that still surround the conflict, it can at least begin to pose new questions that have too often been left unasked or ignored. Through the work of a unique collection of historians, journalists, and war participants <i>Rolling Thunder</i> <i>in a Gentle Land </i>also seeks to spark historical debate and research by searching for new contextual answers to questions that many historians had thought long since answered - sometimes calling for a needed revision of the historical orthodoxy of the conflict. Thus the present study proposes to take fresh looks at several of the most important aspects of the Vietnam War and hopes to demonstrate that the field remains one of the most vibrant and important fields available to future historical inquiry of all types by scholars and laymen alike who seek an opportunity to help define a war of unending complexity.<br><br>CHAPTER HEADS An American war?

In Her Own Words...<p>"I decided to be a writer at the age of eight, but I did not receive any encouragement in this ambition until thirty years later. I think this ambition was fired-or perhaps exacerbated is a better word-by early marginal contacts with the Great, when we were evacuated to the English Lakes during the war. The house we were in had belonged to Ruskin's secretary and had also been the home of the children in the books of Arthur Ransome. One day, finding I had no paper to draw on, I stole from the attic a stack of exquisite flower-drawings, almost certainly by Ruskin himself, and proceeded to rub them out. I was punished for this. Soon after, we children offended Arthur Ransome by making a noise on the shore beside his houseboat. He complained. So likewise did Beatrix Potter, who lived nearby. It struck me then that the Great were remarkably touchy and unpleasant (even if, in Ruskin's case, it was posthumous), and I thought I would like to be the same, without the unpleasantness.</p><p>"I started writing children's books when we moved to a village in Essex where there were almost no books. The main activities there were hand-weaving, hand-making pottery, and singing madrigals, for none of which I had either taste or talent. So, in intervals between trying to haunt the church and sitting on roofs hoping to learn to fly, I wrote enormous epic adventure stories which I read to my sisters instead of the real books we did not have. This writing was stopped, though, when it was decided I must be coached to go to University. A local philosopher was engaged to teach me Greek and philosophy in exchange for a dollhouse (my family never did things normally), and I eventually got a place at Oxford.</p><p>"At this stage, despite attending lectures by J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis, I did not expect to be writing fantasy. But that was what I started to write when I was married and had children of my own. It was what they liked best. But small children do not allow you the use of your brain. They used to jump on my feet to stop me thinking. And I had not realized how much I needed to teach myself about writing. I took years to learn, and it was not until my youngest child began school that I was able to produce a book which a publisher did not send straight back.</p><p>"As soon as my books began to be published, they started coming true. Fantastic things that I thought I had made up keep happening to me. The most spectacular was<i> Drowned Ammet</i>. The first time I went on a boat after writing that book, an island grew up out of the sea and stranded us. This sort of thing, combined with the fact that I have a travel jinx, means that my life is never dull."</p><p>Diana Wynne Jones is the author of many highly praised books for young readers, as well as three plays for children and a novel for adults. She lives in Bristol, England, with her husband, a professor of English at Bristol University.

Some observers believe the absence of a third world war confirms that these weapons were a prudent and cost-effective response to the uncertainty and fear surrounding the Soviet Union's military and political ambitions during the cold war. As early as 1950, nuclear weapons were considered relatively inexpensive&#x2014; providing "a bigger bang for a buck"&#x2014;and were thoroughly integrated into U.S. forces on that basis. Yet this assumption was never validated. Indeed, for more than fifty years scant attention has been paid to the enormous costs of this effort&#x2014;more than $5 trillion thus far&#x2014;and its short and long-term consequences for the nation. Based on four years of extensive research, Atomic Audit is the first book to document the comprehensive costs of U.S. nuclear weapons, assembling for the first time anywhere the actual and estimated expenditures for the program since its creation in 1940. The authors provide a unique perspective on U.S. nuclear policy and nuclear weapons, tracking their development from the Manhattan Project of World War II to the present day and assessing each aspect of the program, including research, development, testing, and production; deployment; command, control, communications, and intelligence; and defensive measures. They also examine the costs of dismantling nuclear weapons, the management and disposal of large quantities of toxic and radioactive wastes left over from their production, compensation for persons harmed by nuclear weapons activities, nuclear secrecy, and the economic implications of nuclear deterrence.</p><br><br><p>Utilizing archival and newly declassified government documents and data, this richly documented book demonstrates how a variety of factors&#x2014;the open-ended nature of nuclear deterrence, faulty assumptions about the cost-effectiveness of nuclear weapons, regular misrepresentation of and overreaction to the Soviet threat, the desire to maintain nuclear superiority, bureaucratic and often arbitrary decisions, pork barrel politics, and excessive secrecy&#x2014;all drove the acquisition of an arsenal far larger than what many contemporary civilian and military leaders deemed necessary. Atomic Audit concludes with recommendations for strengthening atomic accountability and fostering greater public understanding of nuclear weapons programs and policies.</p><br><br></p><p>Photographs and mapsBased on four years of extensive research, Atomic Audit is the first book to document the comprehensive costs of U.S. nuclear weapons, assembling for the first time anywhere the actual and estimated expenditures for the program since its creation in 1940.

But when you&#39;re big, hairy and loud, it&#39;s hard to keep your powers a secret, especially when there are trickster ravens that want the magic for themselves. You won&#39;t want to miss this second rrrawesome adventure of Bigfoot Boy and his friends!</p><p>J. Torres is an award-winning writer whose other graphic novels include Alison Dare, Jinx, and Power Lunch. J. lives in Whitby, Ontario.Gr 4&#x2013;7&#x2014;Rufus is on a weekend visit to his grandma's house in the country. His spirit animal, a squirrel named Sidney, is along for the ride. The story opens with a short recap of Into the Woods (Kids Can, 2012): in an attempt to stop the destruction of a forest, Rufus calls upon Thunderbird for the power to stop the giant trucks. Thunderbird tells Rufus to carve a totem, which he soon learns will turn him into a Sasquatch. Readers are occasionally directed to the first title, which is an effective technique to explain things to children unfamiliar with that book, but the story does not suffer if they miss those references. All is going well for Rufus and his friend Penny as they explore the woods, until ravens begin to appear in trees overhead. They are plotting to steal Rufus's totem, but they have the same goal as he does: to protect the forest. Though the ravens know they cannot take the totem by force, they are confident they can outwit Rufus, Penny, and Sidney. This leads to an adventurous battle over the totem. Hicks's illustrations are done in bold, black lines and rich colors and are sometimes reminiscent of Native Canadian art styles. The story's adventure, magic, and characters will appeal to many readers.&#x2014;Liz Zylstra, County of Prince Edward Public Library, Picton, Ontario</p><h2>The Collected Blurtings of Baxter</h2><p>Glen Baxter&#39;s art appeals to a universal sense of the ridiculous.

Throughout the War of Independence (1948), the PAL&#39;MACH (Hebrew abbreviation for &#39;Strike Companies&#39;) spearheaded Israel&#39;s forces. Disbanded in 1949, the PAL&#39;MACH was replaced by other specialist units, including paratroop forces, the GOLANI Infantry Brigade, the Naval Commandos, and territorial and other reconnaissance commando formations. An acknowledged expert on the Israeli Defence Forces, Samuel Katz presents an overview of these IDF elite units, including the mysterious SAYERET MAT&#39;KAL, a highly classified elite unit whose exploits involve the 1972 raid on a hijacked Belgian Sabena Boeing 707.</p><p>An unrivalled illustrated reference source on fighting men and commanders, past and present.

The problem, as Jeff Gillman points out in this fascinating, well-researched book, is that it is not always true, and the exceptions to the rule can pose a significant threat to human health. To cite just one example, animal manures in compost can be a source of harmful <i>E. coli</i> contamination if imporperly treated. Gillman's contention is that all gardening products and practices&#x2014;organic and synthetic&#x2014;need to be examined on a case-by-case basis to determine both whether they are safe and whether they accomplish the task for which they are intended.</p><p>Ultimately, Gillman concludes, organic methods are preferable in most situations that gardeners are likely to encounter. After reading this eye-opening book, you will understand why, and why knowledge is the gardener's most important tool.</p></p><p><b>The benefits and drawbacks of more than 100 techniques and products</b><br><br> We all want a silver bullet: the pesticide that will kill the pests and be safe for us and for other animals and beneficial insects, the fertilizer that will give us enormous tomatoes and cucumbers without negative side effects to the environment.<br><br> Unfortunately, this silver bullet doesn't exist and probably never will. Gillman introduces over 100 gardening products and practices&#x2014;organic and synthetic&#x2014;and examines each to determine whether it is safe and whether it acomplishes the task for which it is intended. Experienced gardeners on both sides of the organic debate will come away in a much better position to make responsible, efective choices.Jeff Gillman is an associate professor in the department of horticultural science at the University of Minnesota, where he researches plant production and teaches courses on nursery management and pesticide use.

Intrigued by Polynesian folklore, biologist Thor Heyerdahl suspected that the South Sea Islands had been settled by an ancient race from thousands of miles to the east, led by a mythical hero, Kon-Tiki. He decided to prove his theory by duplicating the legendary voyage. On April 28, 1947, Heyerdahl and five other adventurers sailed from Peru on a balsa log raft. After three months on the open sea, encountering raging storms, whales, and sharks, they sighted land -- the Polynesian island of Puka Puka. Translated into sixty-five languages, Kon-Tiki is a classic, inspiring tale of daring and courage -- a magnificent saga of men against the sea. Washington Square Press&#39; Enriched Classics present the great works of world literature enhanced for the contemporary reader. This edition of Kon-Tiki has been prepared by an editorial committee headed by Harry Shefter, professor of English at New York University.

American Assassin </i>will be released as a major film in 2017.The Last Man CHAPTER 1<p></p> <br>JALALABAD, AFGHANISTAN<br> <br>THE four dead men were lined up on the living room floor of the safe house. Mitch Rapp started with the one on the left. The bearded face, the dark, lifeless eyes, and the dime-sized bullet hole that marked the center of the man&#x2019;s forehead were all expected. One bullet, nice and neat&#x2014;the way Rapp would have done it. The next two bodyguards looked the same, including red pucker marks in the center of their brows. The fourth Afghani was a different story. He&#x2019;d been shot through the back of the head. A quarter of his face was now a jagged crater of flesh, blood, and bone. The exit wound told him the man had been shot by something a lot bigger than a 9mm&#x2014;probably a .45 caliber with ammunition that pancaked and tumbled for maximum damage. There was nothing about this mess to give Rapp any assurance that things would be fine, but this last little twist cracked open the door on something he did not want to consider.<br> <br>Rapp set the troubling thought aside for a second, tried to imagine how it had gone down. The early signs pointed toward a well-coordinated assault. The perimeter security had been breached; phone line, cameras, motion sensors, heat sensors, and even the pressure pads had all been taken off-line. The backup connection through the satellite dish on the roof had also been disabled. Whoever had attacked the safe house had the knowledge and skill to hit the place without setting off a single alarm and alerting the quick-reaction force less than a mile away at the air base. According to the experts at Langley this was never supposed to happen. Four years earlier they had claimed the safe house was impregnable against any threat that the Taliban or any other local group could come up with. Rapp had told those same experts that they were full of shit. He&#x2019;d never seen an impregnable safe house for the simple reason that people had to come and go.<br> <br>As with most CIA safe houses, this one was intentionally bland. There was no American flag flown out front and there were no snappy Marines standing post at the main gate. This was a black site where the more unpleasant aspects of the war had been coordinated. Langley didn&#x2019;t want any official records of the comings and goings of the drug dealers, warlords, arms dealers, local politicians, police, and Afghan Army officers who were on the take.<br> <br>The house looked like your run-of-the-mill two-story blockhouse in Jalalabad. There were quite a few upgrades that made it unique, but from the outside it looked dingy and run-down just like all the other houses in the neighborhood. The cinderblock wall that surrounded the property was coated with a special resin designed to prevent it from exploding into a million pieces and shredding the house in the event of a car bomb. The simple-looking front door contained a one-inch steel plate and a reinforced steel frame. All of the windows were bulletproof Plexiglas and the high-tech security cameras and sensors were concealed so as to not attract the attention of the neighbors. Langley had even taken the unusual precaution of buying the houses on each side and moving in the bodyguards and their families. All to protect one man.<br> <br>Joe Rickman was the most cunning and brilliant operative Rapp had ever worked with. They&#x2019;d known each other for sixteen years. At first Rapp didn&#x2019;t know what to think of him. Rickman was pure vanilla. There wasn&#x2019;t a single physical characteristic about him that was memorable. At five-feet-ten he was neither tall nor short. His mousy brown hair matched his dull brown eyes, and his weak chin completed the bland lines of his roundish face. On the rare occasion that you heard him speak, he was never animated and his voice was pure monotone&#x2014;the kind of thing that could put the most restless baby to sleep.<br> <br>Rickman&#x2019;s forgettable face allowed him to blend in and those who met him were almost underwhelmed by his presence. For Rickman that was just fine. Much of his success was built on fools underestimating him. He&#x2019;d worked for the CIA for twenty-three years and it was rumored that he had never set foot inside headquarters. Only a few months earlier Rapp had asked him if the rumor was true. Rickman responded with a soft smile and said that he&#x2019;d never been invited.<br> <br>At the time, Rapp took the comment as a self-deprecating attempt at a little levity. Later he realized Rickman was dead serious. Rickman was one of those people who were tolerated only during tough times&#x2014;usually war. For the last eight years he&#x2019;d run America&#x2019;s clandestine war in Afghanistan. More than a billion dollars in cash had passed through his hands. Most of it was used to bribe people into playing on the right team, but a fair amount of the money was used to kill enemies and for a laundry list of other unpleasant things that went with the territory. People back at Langley didn&#x2019;t want to know what Rickman was up to. They only wanted results, and that was something Rickman was exceedingly good at. Underneath Rickman&#x2019;s bland fa�ade was a cunning mind that was perfectly suited to the duplicitous, infinitely complicated world of espionage.<br> <br>Rapp understood the tinge of fear in his boss&#x2019;s voice when she&#x2019;d called him a little over two hours ago. When the morning guards showed up, they had discovered the bodies and the absence of Joe Rickman and had immediately alerted John Hubbard, the CIA&#x2019;s Jalalabad base chief. Hubbard rang his boss in Kabul and the shit rolled uphill from there. Rapp received a call from CIA Director Irene Kennedy while he was sitting down for breakfast in the big mess hall at Bagram Air Force Base. He had just arrived in-country the previous evening on a high-priority mission that was now on hold. Kennedy passed along what little information she knew and ordered Rapp to grab the next Blackhawk to Jalalabad. Rapp didn&#x2019;t argue. He and four of his team members made the trip and were on the ground in Jalalabad before nine in the morning. Hubbard met them with a three-SUV convoy and a security detail and they rolled to the house.<br> <br>Langley would want Rickman back, but Rapp got the strange feeling that all things considered, they would prefer the black-ops boss delivered in a body bag. It would be impossible to keep the kidnapping a secret. Rickman&#x2019;s operational knowledge and reach was too vast to ignore. Entire teams would already be gathered at Langley, working around the clock to assess the damage. If Rapp didn&#x2019;t find Rickman quickly, then complex, expensive operations would have to be unwound or assets would start showing up in morgues all across the Middle East, Southwest Asia, and beyond. Sooner or later Congress would get wind of the disaster and they would want answers. For a good number of people back at Langley, the only thing worse than Rickman spilling the Company secrets to an enemy would be Rickman testifying before Congress.<br> <br>Rapp had a long and somewhat complicated history with Rickman. He respected the man, but it had taken a while. Rapp was considering how he would handle a possible order to eliminate Rickman when the towering Hubbard approached.<br> <br>&#x201c;This shit is really bad.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rapp nodded. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about as bad as it could get.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hubbard rubbed his bald head and asked, &#x201c;How in the hell are we going to find him?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;At this point I&#x2019;m not sure.&#x201d; Rapp knew their chances for success were remote, but they had to start somewhere. &#x201c;This is going to get really nasty, and if you don&#x2019;t have the stomach for it, Hub, I suggest you go back to the base and lock yourself in your office.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hubbard studied Rapp for a moment and then nodded. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to worry about me getting all sensitive on you. I&#x2019;ve been over here for two years. I&#x2019;ve seen all kinds of crazy shit.&#x201d;<br> <br>Most of that &#x201c;crazy shit&#x201d; was stuff done by the enemy. This time they would be the ones crossing the line. &#x201c;I know you have,&#x201d; Rapp said, &#x201c;but trust me, if we&#x2019;re going to get him back we are going to have to be more ruthless than you can imagine, and if at any point you start to have doubts, that&#x2019;s fine, step aside, but I need you to promise me you&#x2019;ll stick your head in the sand and keep your mouth shut.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hubbard gave him a nervous smile. &#x201c;I can do a Sergeant Schultz when I need to.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; Rapp replied, even though he had his doubts.<br> <br>&#x201c;So where do you want to start?&#x201d;<br> <br>Rapp returned his attention to the row of dead men. &#x201c;The bodyguards.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hubbard turned his six-foot-five-inch frame toward the row of men and pursed his lips. &#x201c;I think we can rule these four out.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rapp focused on the man with the cratered face. An inside job was the obvious conclusion, but the bodyguards were all hardened Northern Alliance types. It was possible that one of them could have been bribed into giving up the crucial information on the security system, but unlikely. If one of them had turned, however, it was also possible that the Taliban, or whoever was responsible for this, had decided to kill the inside man as soon as they got what they wanted. The wrench in the works was that Rapp was pretty certain the Taliban had nothing to do with this. He pointed at the man missing part of his face. &#x201c;Focus on this one. I want to know everything there is to know about him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. especially his family. Do his parents or wife or kids have medical problems? Does he have a drug problem? Anything you can find.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And the other eight?&#x201d;<br> <br>A team of interrogation experts from D.C. were in flight but not expected to land for another thirteen hours. &#x201c;If you have the manpower, you can get started with them, but I doubt they&#x2019;d hang around after something like this. What would you do if someone gave you a pile of cash to betray your buddies and a man like Rick?&#x201d; Rickman&#x2019;s first name was Joe, but everyone who worked with him called him Rick.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d run.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d; Rapp pointed to the man who&#x2019;d been shot with a .45 caliber. &#x201c;Focus on this one for now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So you think the Taliban turned him?&#x201d;<br> <br>Rapp ignored the question for the moment and asked, &#x201c;Who moved these bodies?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The bodies,&#x201d; Rapp said as he pointed at the row of four. &#x201c;They weren&#x2019;t shot here. Look at the blood on the floor. They were dragged here after they were killed.&#x201d; Rapp pointed at the stairs. &#x201c;One of them was dragged down from the second story.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hubbard shrugged. &#x201c;They were lined up like this when I got here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did the bodyguards move them?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not that I know of. Do you want me to find out?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In a minute.&#x201d; Rapp looked toward the front door where one of the bodyguards was standing post with an AK-47 gripped in both hands. &#x201c;The neighbors&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. did they hear or see anything last night?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. Not a thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No signs of forced entry?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not that we&#x2019;ve discovered, but they wouldn&#x2019;t need to force their way in if one of these guys were helping them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So no forced entry&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. four bodyguards&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. four headshots&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. four dead men. Anything about that seem unusual to you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Hubbard thought about it for a moment and said, &#x201c;Not sure what you&#x2019;re driving at.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rapp pointed at the bodies one after another, saying, &#x201c;Nine-millimeter, nine-millimeter, nine-millimeter, .45 caliber, and my bet is they were all fired from suppressed weapons. Pretty accurate work. Good fire discipline. Look at the walls.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hubbard did a 360-degree turn and said, &#x201c;What about them?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You see anything?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the point. You ever seen the Taliban operate like this? Four shots, four hits, and not a shot more. The Taliban likes to get the lead out. You know their MO. They would have rolled up on this place with three or four trucks and started unloading RPG rounds at all three buildings. This place would be riddled with bullets. This was done by pros.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hubbard made a sour face and then nodded. &#x201c;Yeah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you&#x2019;re right. The towelheads like to blow shit up. This is more like something our guys would do&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hubbard kept talking, but Rapp had stopped listening. The idea that U.S. Special Operators had been involved was something he hadn&#x2019;t considered and something he didn&#x2019;t want to consider. From the moment Rapp had heard Rickman was missing, there was a gnawing fear that he was about to head down the rabbit hole. Rickman excelled at his job for the simple reason that he could think five, ten, fifteen, even twenty steps ahead of the enemy, and everyone else, for that matter. There had been many times when Rapp didn&#x2019;t understand what the man was up to because he wasn&#x2019;t smart enough to follow Rick&#x2019;s thinking.<br> <br>&#x201c;How about those assholes from the ISI?&#x201d; Hubbard asked.<br> <br>Rapp had considered the less-than-loyal members of the Pakistani Intelligence Service. They would be on the list as well as others. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget the Iranians, the Russians, and the Chinese.&#x201d; And there was one other possibility that Rapp wasn&#x2019;t quite prepared to mention.<br> <br>&#x201c;My money&#x2019;s on the ISI. This is just the kind of bullshit they&#x2019;d pull.&#x201d;<br> <br>A thought occurred to Rapp. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the dog? That big frickin&#x2019; Rottweiler that never left Rick&#x2019;s side?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ajax&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he died a month ago.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rapp was surprised by the news. &#x201c;What was wrong with him?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know. Rick was pretty bummed out, though. Dog got sick, he took him to the vet and had to put him down. I think Rick said it was cancer or something like that.&#x201d;<br> <br>One of Rapp&#x2019;s team members came down the stairs with a disturbed look on his face.

It is literally a gift - a gift of God's power. While carefully maintaining the sacred confidentiality of the temple ordinances, this book provides scriptural correlations which will open up rich new areas of understanding. Once you read this inspired information, you will be better informed about the scriptural authority and symbolism of the sacred ordinances. You will be better prepared and motivated to apply scriptural symbols in your life and strive to become more like Christ. <p>Within these pages are more than twenty scriptural symbols which correlate with the temple service. The central focus of these symbols is found in Brigham Young's oft-quoted statement of the ceremony's ultimate purpose: to enable recipients to pass by the angelic sentinels who guard the entrance to God's kingdom as they "walk back to the presence of the Father." </p><p>Endowed from on high teaches that revelation occurs during the endowment, that promises are required before blessings are granted, that covenants are the channels through which blessings flow, and that the Lord is voluntarily "bound" when we obey His commandments. This is a unique and reverential guide to growth in the most sacred of all areas of our relationship with the Savior and our heavenly Father. Reading and pondering Endowen From On High will be a choice experience for all Church members.</p></p><p></p><h2>The True Adventures of Grizzly Adams: A Biography</h2><p>Recounts the adventures of the nineteenth-century frontier hunter, with an emphasis on his experiences with bears.</p><p>Bob McClung&#39;s books have won a number of awards and citations, including, in 1966, the Eva L. Gordon Award of the American Nature Study Society for outstanding achievement in nature literature and, in 1978, the Golden Kite Award from the Society of Children&#39;s Book Writers for the outstanding nonfiction book for children written that year by a member. Many of his books have also been cited as Outstanding Trade Books for Children by the National Science Teachers Association.Grade 7 Up An account of the fantabulous adult years of Grizzly Adams, chiefly in the Sierra Nevadas of California. The intrepid Adams was known as a trapper and a tamer of the largest of bears as well as of other carnivors; a hunter for meat to feed his managerie, his men, Indians, emigrants and miners; and a showman, both on his own, and in the last year of his life, with P. T. Barnum in New York. Adams' activities were so extraordinary that they read as if created expressly to be the substance of dime novels. What else could one make of a man who for many years was companion to a female grizzly bear, Lady Washington, with whom on frigid nights he slept? Yet one must not overlook that as a hunter and collector of animals, Adams was also a businessman, selling furs, meat and live specimens. Readers who are unfamiliar with the geography of the West will be able to follow Adams' travels on the maps included; reproductions of contemporary illustrations add visual information and ambiance to the text. Readers who favor rough and ready adventures so rare that they seem to be exaggerations will read and reread this biography.

It is not the act of sex itself but the flippancy of one-night stands, the viewing of pornography and the engaging of the mind in sexual fantasies that most drastically turn our sight from God.

What keeps him there? It could be his bright, sensitive daughter Tick, who needs all his help surviving the local high school. Or maybe it&#x2019;s Janine, Miles&#x2019; soon-to-be ex-wife, who&#x2019;s taken up with a noxiously vain health-club proprietor. Or perhaps it&#x2019;s the imperious Francine Whiting, who owns everything in town&#x2013;and seems to believe that &#x201c;everything&#x201d; includes Miles himself. In <b>Empire Falls</b><i> </i>Richard Russo delves deep into the blue-collar heart of America in a work that overflows with hilarity, heartache, and grace.</p><p>Like most of Richard Russo's earlier novels, <i>Empire Falls</i> is a tale of blue-collar life, which itself increasingly resembles a kind of high-wire act performed without the benefit of any middle-class safety nets. This time, though, the author has widened his scope, producing a comic and compelling ensemble piece. There is, to be sure, a protagonist: fortysomething Miles Roby, proprietor of the local greasy spoon and the recently divorced father of a teenage daughter. But Russo sets in motion a large cast of secondary characters, drawn from every social stratum of his depressed New England mill town. We meet his ex-wife Janine, his father Max (another of Russo's cantankerous layabouts), and a host of Empire Grill regulars. We're also introduced to Francine Whiting, a manipulative widow who owns half the town--and who takes a perverse pleasure in pointing out Miles's psychological defects. <p> Miles does indeed have a tendency to take it on the chin. (At one point he alludes to his own "natural propensity for shit-eating.") And his role as Mr. Nice Guy thrusts him into all sorts of clashes with his not-so-nice contemporaries, even as the reader patiently waits for him to blow his top. It would be impossible to summarize Russo's multiple plot lines here. Suffice it to say that he touches on love and marriage, lust and loss and small-town economics, with more than a soup�on of class resentment stirred into the broth. This is, in a sense, an epic of small and large frustrations: "After all, what was the whole wide world but a place for people to yearn for their heart's impossible desires, for those desires to become entrenched in defiance of logic, plausibility, and even the passage of time, as eternal as polished marble." Yet Russo's comedic timing keeps the novel from collapsing into an orgy of breast-beating, and his dialogue alone--snappy and natural and efficiently poignant--is sufficient cause to put <i>Empire Falls</i> on the map. <i>--Bob Brandeis</i></p>&#x201c;Rich, humorous, elegantly constructed . . .

Fortunately, D Day paratrooper Joseph Beyrle met author Thomas H. Taylor in time to record <i>The Simple Sounds of Freedom</i>, the true story of the first American paratrooper to land in Normandy and the only soldier to fight for both the United States and the Soviet Union against Nazi Germany.<br><br>It is a story of battle, followed by a succession of captures, escapes, recaptures, and re-escapes, then battle once more, in the final months of fighting on the Eastern Front. For these unique experiences, both President Bill Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin honored Joe Beyrle on the fiftieth anniversary of V-E Day.<br><br>Beyrle did not strive to be a part of history, but history kept visiting him. Twice before the invasion he parachuted into Normandy, bearing gold for the French resistance. D Day resulted in his capture, and he was mistaken for a German line-crosser&#x2014;a soldier who had, in fact, died in the attempt. Eventually Joe was held under guard at the American embassy in Moscow, suspected of being a Nazi assassin.<br><br>Fingerprints saved him, confirming that he&#x2019;d been wounded five times, and that he bore a safe-conduct pass written by Marshal Zhukov after the Wehrmacht wrested Joe, at gunpoint, from execution by the Gestapo. In the ruins of Warsaw his life was saved again, this time by Polish nuns. Some of Joe&#x2019;s story is in his own words&#x2014;a voice that will be among the last and best we hear firsthand from World War II.</p><p>Advance praise for <b><i>The Simple Sounds of Freedom</i></b><br><br>&#x201d;War, combat, warrior. All connected, all self-explanatory&#x2014;except why? The official &#x2018;why&#x2019; or cause of war is not the concern of the one who does the fighting; the warrior has his own reasons for doing battle, his own priorities. Joe Beyrle, raised in western Michigan during the Great Depression of the thirties by not-so-well-to-do but devout Christian parents, had his own reasons for answering his country&#x2019;s call to arms.<br><br>&#x201c;Joe Beyrle&#x2019;s decision to volunteer for the newly formed paratroopers was the first episode in one of the most bizarre stories of World War II. Parachuting alone behind enemy lines weeks before D Day made Joe the first American soldier to land in Normandy in World War II. Returning to Allied lines, he again parachuted into Normandy on D Day, June 6, 1944, with the American 101st Airborne Division, the Screaming Eagles. The trail he followed and his experiences of capture, torture, and eventual combat with a Russian armored battalion on the Eastern Front are incredible.<br><br>&#x201c;Through his words the reader will learn why Americans like Joe Beyrle can and do endure unspeakable torture and are willing to continue the most grueling battles, to the point of sacrificing their own lives.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<b>Donald R.

Getting there early gave me a chance to look at video, read scouting reports, go over possible late-inning matchups, and create a game plan for my starting pitcher. <br>Getting there early also allowed me to avoid autograph seekers. Kids are different&#x2014;every ballplayer I know makes time for kids. But the people who want you to sign an autograph at twelve thirty in the afternoon usually aren&#x2019;t kids. They&#x2019;re mostly adults wanting to get items signed. And many of them resell those items. Even when it <i>is</i> a kid, the experience can leave you bitter. You try to personalize a ball for a kid&#x2014;put his name on it&#x2014;and his dad tells you, &#x201c;No thanks, just sign it&#x201d;? <br>The dad wants to resell the ball. <br>You see the same guy every day, and every day he asks you to sign something. How many autographed baseballs does one guy need? Honestly, what can you get for a signed Jason Kendall card? One cent? Two cents? Ten? When the same guy asks you to sign something every day, players know he&#x2019;s reselling those items and don&#x2019;t feel bad about blowing the guy off. After a game you come out and sign twenty autographs, the twenty-first guy doesn&#x2019;t get one and he calls you an asshole in front of your son. <i>Really?</i> Here&#x2019;s the deal: I&#x2019;m done signing because I&#x2019;m trying to get my son to bed so he can go to school tomorrow. <br>That kind of thing ruins the experience for everyone. <br>I&#x2019;m grumpy&#x2014;everybody <i>knows</i> I&#x2019;m grumpy. If I&#x2019;ve got work to do at 12:30 to get ready for that night&#x2019;s game and if it&#x2019;s 12:25, I ain&#x2019;t signing shit. <br>Early work <br>I got to the ballpark earlier than most, but all ballplayers are at the park early in the afternoon, getting ready for that night&#x2019;s game. Fans don&#x2019;t see everything we have to do to get ready for that 7:05 game. Players have work they do on their own, but teams also schedule early work for individuals or groups. <br>Early work means anything done before the team stretch and batting practice. We usually don&#x2019;t do early work before a day game, but for a night game, there&#x2019;s almost always something happening on the field by two or three in the afternoon. <br>Early work can be anything done on the field: extra batting practice, working on bunting, a middle infielder wants to clean up his double-play footwork, or the base stealers are listening to a coach go over the other team&#x2019;s starting pitcher and his pickoff move. Early work can be scheduled by a coach, or a player might ask to work on something. <br>And some early work is eyewash. <br>Eyewash is anything done just because it looks good. The owner&#x2019;s in town today? Let&#x2019;s run the bases: let&#x2019;s work on our secondary leads and going first to third. A coach who&#x2019;s trying to protect his job might want everyone to see how hard he&#x2019;s working and schedule early work for the players. That can actually be a negative: you&#x2019;re twenty games out of first place, it&#x2019;s August, and the players are dragging&#x2014;do they really need extra time in the sun? If you don&#x2019;t know how to run the bases by August, you&#x2019;re already screwed. <br>If you&#x2019;re a big league ballplayer, you should know what you have to do to get ready for a game. But whether it&#x2019;s needed or not, somebody is doing early work almost every day. Players don&#x2019;t just show up an hour before game time, throw on a uniform, and go. <br>It&#x2019;s one thing to get to the big leagues&#x2014;it&#x2019;s another thing to stay. Someone is always trying to take your job. If you want to stick around, you better be prepared to play. <br>The ballpark <br>Part of being prepared to play is knowing the ballpark. Every ballpark has quirks, and players need to know what they are. In Boston, the Green Monster&#x2014;the thirty-seven-foot-high left-field wall&#x2014;changes the way you run the bases. The Monster is so close to the infield, taking the extra base on a ball off the wall may not be possible. <br>When you played the Twins in the Metrodome, you had to know you couldn&#x2019;t take your eye off a fly ball: the roof was white. Take your eye off a pop fly and you may never see it again. <br>In Toronto, the warning track is a different color, but it&#x2019;s made of the same stuff as the rest of the outfield: turf. In most parks, outfielders know they&#x2019;re getting near a wall when they step off the grass and feel themselves running on dirt. An outfielder going back on a ball in Rogers Centre needs to know he won&#x2019;t get the usual warning before he hits the wall. <br>If a bad throw gets past the first baseman in Oakland, there&#x2019;s so much foul territory, a runner going down the first-base line can automatically turn for second base and <i>should</i> be thinking about getting all the way to third. In Kansas City, the same ball might hit a screen protecting a camera bay and come right back to the first baseman&#x2014;the runner can&#x2019;t advance at all. <br>In <i>every</i> park, players need to check the area behind home plate. How close is the backstop? Is it padded or brick? Can a runner on third automatically score on a wild pitch? Base runners need to know this stuff before they take off for home plate and then realize the ball is bouncing right back to the catcher. <br>Every ballpark is different, and ballplayers need to know how each park can change the game. If a player is unfamiliar with a park, before the game a coach will hit baseballs off all the surfaces that might come into play. That way the player can see how he needs to play each ball. You need to know all this stuff before the game starts. You don&#x2019;t want to play a ball off the wall in front of forty thousand people and then realize you&#x2019;re standing in the wrong place. <br>Conditions <br>Players also need to check the flags: Is the wind blowing in? That might mean a low-scoring game. A smart pitcher can use the conditions by letting a batter crush a ball&#x2014;straight into the wind. Here it is, dude, hit it as hard as you want; with this wind howling, it ain&#x2019;t going anywhere. If the wind&#x2019;s blowing out, it might mean a high-scoring game. Then the pitcher <i>really</i> needs to keep the ball down. He doesn&#x2019;t want a routine fly ball getting pushed out of the park by a strong breeze. <br>The inning can also make a difference. If it&#x2019;s a night game&#x2014;depending on where you are&#x2014;the ball might fly better in the early innings. Once it gets cool, the ball won&#x2019;t carry as well. A pitch that left the park at 6:15 might be a long out at 9:15. If it&#x2019;s a day game, it might be the opposite; the ball might jump better in the later innings when it&#x2019;s smoking hot. <br>Ballplayers also pay attention to the shadows. Vision is everything in this game, and if you can&#x2019;t see the ball, it changes the way the game is played. If it&#x2019;s a 1:10 start, the shadows will come into play late in the ball game. When there&#x2019;s a shadow halfway between home and the mound, it&#x2019;s hard to pick up the ball. Some people think you should throw more fastballs when visibility is tough, some people think you should throw more breaking stuff. But the main thing is to work quick. Once a pitcher has the shadows working in his favor, he needs to use them to get as many outs as possible. <br>If it&#x2019;s a night game, especially a 6:05 start on a Saturday, the setting sun can be a problem in the early innings. In some parks, the first baseman can&#x2019;t see a pickoff throw until the sun goes down. Colorado&#x2019;s the worst. Early in the game, the pitcher needs to keep any pickoff attempt low; that way his first baseman won&#x2019;t be blinded by the sun. If the sun is in the right fielder&#x2019;s eyes for the first two innings, he&#x2019;s not likely to come up with a great catch and throw on a sacrifice fly&#x2014;the third-base coach and a runner on third need to know that. The runner might be able to score on a fly ball hit to right in the second inning and have to hold on the same fly ball an inning later. <br>Players need to know this stuff before the game starts. <br>Batting practice <br>Batting practice is a war zone. If the people on the field don&#x2019;t pay attention, they can take a line drive to the head. These are grown men at the plate, and the ball is coming off the bat <i>hot</i>. When you&#x2019;re standing at third base and the ball is traveling one hundred miles an hour, it doesn&#x2019;t take long to get on you. <br>That&#x2019;s why BP has to be planned out. A coach throws a pitch and the hitter swings. Another coach&#x2014;standing off to the side of the batting cage&#x2014;uses a fungo bat to hit a ball to an infielder. The coach hitting fungoes has to time it so that two balls aren&#x2019;t heading toward the same infielder. Make a mistake and you can jack up a multimillion-dollar player. Sometimes another coach is on the other side of the batting cage hitting <i>another</i> fungo to a <i>different</i> infielder. Three or four balls can be in play at the same time, all headed to different parts of the field. It&#x2019;s a rhythm. Break the rhythm&#x2014;look in the wrong direction at the wrong time&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s easy to get drilled. If you watch BP, everyone on the field is paying attention. <br>If fans want to know what&#x2019;s going on, they should, too. <br>Pay attention during batting practice: Take your eye off the hitter and watch the fielders. See who gets his work in and who&#x2019;s goofing around. Does the second baseman flip the double-play ball to the shortstop at second base the same way he will in the game? Or is he playing around with behind-the-back flips? Is the left fielder approaching balls at game speed or is he just going through the motions? <br>Once a guy has his work in, he may stand around and joke with a teammate, but when it&#x2019;s time to do his job, he needs to go about it the right way&#x2014;work ethic is just as important for ballplayers as it is for everybody else. The guys who take this work seriously are the guys who stick around the game for a while. And they&#x2019;re the same guys you want fielding the ball with the game on the line. The guys who goof around when they should be working may not have a long career. <br>Now look back at the hitter: if he&#x2019;s taking <i>his</i> job seriously, he&#x2019;s not up there playing home-run derby. Fans might like to see a guy hit ball after ball into the seats, but it&#x2019;s not good batting practice. Every team has a batting-practice routine. They can vary some, but here&#x2019;s an example: <br>FIRST ROUND: <br>The hitter lays down two bunts, one to first, one to third, then hits seven balls to the opposite field. <br>SECOND ROUND: <br>First swing: hit and run (the runner will force a middle infielder to cover second base, so right-handers hit a ground ball toward the hole at second, left-handers hit a ground ball toward the hole at short). <br>Second swing: move the runner over from second to third (the ball needs to be hit to the right side). <br>Third swing: get the runner in from third with the infield back (a fly ball to the outfield or a ground ball to short or second will do). <br>Fourth swing: get the runner in from third with the infield in (the ball needs to be hit in the air to the outfield). <br>Fifth swing: a suicide squeeze. <br>The last three swings: hit away. <br>THIRD ROUND: <br>Everyone in the hitting group takes five swings, then rotates through again and takes two more swings. <br>If a guy wants to load up and hit a long ball, it&#x2019;s usually in that third round. But before that, line drives, hard grounders, and balls hit the other way should be the goal. Pay attention to who takes this work seriously, and you&#x2019;ll have a better idea of who will come through when he faces the same situation in a game. <br>A good time to ask for autographs <br>If you want an autograph, try asking after batting practice. Ask as the team leaves the field, but like everybody else, we&#x2019;re on a schedule. Different players have different routines, and it&#x2019;s important to stick to those routines. <i>You</i> may read a newspaper and have a cup of coffee at the same time every day. It helps you function and gets you started on your day. The same thing applies to ballplayers: we&#x2019;ve all got a routine that helps us function. <br>If it&#x2019;s me, I was coming off BP at the same time every day. I had a routine: I left the field, headed back to the clubhouse, went over the scouting reports one more time, and took one last look at my notes. That was my job. At that point in the day, I was so mentally locked in I might not have signed for you. I was so locked in I might not have even <i>noticed</i> you. <br>Some guys sign autographs every day. Stopping on the way in from BP and signing autographs may be part of <i>their</i> routine. Position players, outfielders, pitchers&#x2014;most of the time&#x2014;they&#x2019;ll sign; especially if a kid asks. Although when a ten-year-old asks you to sign a ball on the &#x201c;sweet spot&#x201d;&#x2014;the narrow spot between the seams and the spot favored by autograph collectors&#x2014;you figure an adult put him up to it. When that happens, we&#x2019;ll ask the kid&#x2019;s name and personalize the ball, just to make sure it can&#x2019;t be resold. <br>Ballplayers want to do what they can for the fans, but walking over to sign one autograph might turn into signing ten. Sign ten and the eleventh person who wanted an autograph will be upset. The time it took to sign those ten autographs may mean a player comes up five swings short in the batting cage. It may mean he doesn&#x2019;t have time to go over the scouting report one last time. I&#x2019;ve had a routine from my first day in the big leagues all the way to my last game. I always got to the park early. If I got to the ballpark late, it was because of my kids. If I got off my routine&#x2014;if I wasn&#x2019;t stretching in the indoor batting cages before 6:01&#x2014;I felt like I was going to have a bad game. <br>Have enough bad games and no one&#x2019;s going to <i>want</i> your autograph. <br>The meeting at the plate <br>At this point in the pregame schedule, players have changed into game uniforms and are back on the field. They&#x2019;ve had a chance to relax, take one last look at scouting reports, or watch video. They might be down in the indoor batting cages, taking a few more hacks. <br>The umpire and the managers&#x2014;or whoever the manager sends out with the lineup card&#x2014;meet at home plate and go over what&#x2019;s in play and what isn&#x2019;t. If the park had some off-season renovations, the umpire will point out those changes to the visiting team. The meeting at the plate is probably longer before the first game of each series, but before games two or three, the guys at the plate are probably making dinner plans or telling jokes. <br>The national anthem <br>Bottom line: the faster the better. I know singing the anthem is a pretty big thing for the singers&#x2014;but hurry up. You want to get a big ovation? Get it done. <br>Put it this way: if you&#x2019;re gonna be slow, you better be good. <br>I&#x2019;ve heard thousands and thousands of national anthems, but my favorite took place in the minor leagues. I was playing High-A ball for the Pirates, and one of the coaches was Rocky Bridges. I&#x2019;m standing next to Rocky, listening to the anthem, when he says, &#x201c;Hey, kid, I hate this song. You know why? Every time they played this [bleeping] song, I had a bad game.&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t know what else I should have expected; Rocky had a personalized license plate that said O FOR 4. <br>Okay, song&#x2019;s over&#x2014;time to play ball. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2014 by Jason Kendall and Lee Judge</p><h2>The Sacred Center: The Ancient Art of Locating Sanctuaries</h2><p>The symbolism and power behind sacred locations in ancient and modern times <br> <br>� Explains the need and role for ritual centers in modern society <br> <br>� Examines ancient territorial centers in ancient Egypt, Greece, Africa and Asia, and Iceland and the British Isles <br> <br>� Reveals the code of number and geometry behind the idealistic social structure of the ritual center, formed to imitate the heavenly order <br> <br>Symbols of ritual centers are among the most persistent elements of myth and belief between cultures widely separated in time and space.

I am watching one right now.In a darkened room in the District 8 Police Station with my good friend FBI agent Kimberley Jones, a forty-two-inch Toshiba LCD monitor hangs high up on a wall, out of the reach of villains.The video I&#x2019;m sharing with the FBI uses two industrial-quality cameras that between them seamlessly provide all the tricks of zoom, angle, pan, et cetera, and I am told that at least two technicians must have been involved in its production. The color is excellent, thanks to however many millions of pixels that contribute to their subtle shading; we are looking at a product of high civilization unknown to our forefathers. At the end of the movie, though, tough-guy Kimberley bursts into tears, as I&#x2019;d rather hoped she would. I did. She turns her head to stare at me wild-eyed.&#x201c;Tell me it isn&#x2019;t real.&#x201d;&#x201c;We have the body,&#x201d; I say.&#x201c;Oh, god,&#x201d; Kimberley says. &#x201c;Oh, sweet Jesus, I&#x2019;ve seen things bloodier, but never anything this demonic. I thought I&#x2019;d seen everything.&#x201d; She stands up. &#x201c;I need air.&#x201d;I think, <i>In Bangkok</i>? But I lead her through a couple of corridors, then out into the public area, where brown men and women not much more than half her size wait to tell a cop of their homely grievances. It&#x2019;s not exactly a festive atmosphere, but it&#x2019;s human. An American extrovert, Kimberley doesn&#x2019;t mind dabbing her red eyes with a tissue in front of an audience, who naturally assume I&#x2019;ve just busted this female farang on some minor drug charge&#x2014;cannabis, perhaps. Like my own, her eyes naturally seek out any attractive young women sitting in the plastic seats. There are three, all of them prostitutes. (No respectable Thai woman dresses like that.) They resent the attention and glare back. I think Kimberley would like to hug them in gratitude that they&#x2019;re still alive. I take her out into the street: not quite what the words<i> fresh air</i> normally invoke, but she fills her lungs anyway. &#x201c;My god, Sonchai. The world. What monsters are we creating?&#x201d;We have achieved that rare thing, Kimberley and I: a sexless but intimate rapport between a man and a woman of the same age who are mutually attracted to each other but, for reasons beyond analysis, have decided to do nothing about it. Even so, I was surprised when she simply got on a plane in response to a frantic telephone call from me. I had no idea she was specializing in snuff movies these days; nor did I realize they were flavor of the month in international law enforcement. Anyway, it&#x2019;s great to have a top-notch pro familiar with the latest technology on my side. She&#x2019;s not intuitive, as I am, but owns a mind like a steel trap. So do I treat her like a woman or a man? Are there any rules about that where she comes from? I give her a comradely embrace and squeeze her hand, which seems to cover most points. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s great to have you here, Kimberley,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Thanks again for coming.&#x201d;She smiles with that innocence that can follow an emotional catastrophe. &#x201c;Sorry to be a girl.&#x201d;&#x201c;I was a girl too, the first time I saw it.&#x201d;She nods, unsurprised. &#x201c;Where did you get it, in a raid?&#x201d;I shake my head. &#x201c;No, it was sent to me anonymously, to my home.&#x201d; She gives me a knowing look: a personal angle here.&#x201c;And the body, where was it found? At the crime scene?&#x201d;&#x201c;No. It had been returned to her apartment, laid neatly on the bed. Forensics says she must have been killed somewhere else.&#x201d;Now the American Hero emerges. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re gonna get them, Sonchai. Tell me what you need, and I&#x2019;ll find a way of getting it to you.&#x201d;&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t make promises,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t Iraq.&#x201d;She frowns. I guess a lot of Americans are tired of hearing those kinds of jibes. &#x201c;No, but that movie had a certain style, a certain professionalism about it, and if that alpha male isn&#x2019;t North American, I&#x2019;ll turn in my badge.&#x201d;&#x201c;A Hollywood production?&#x201d;&#x201c;For something like that, frankly the U.S. is the first place I would start looking. Specifically California, but not Hollywood. San Fernando Valley, maybe, with international connections. This could tie in with what I&#x2019;m doing stateside.&#x201d;&#x201c;What would you look for? He was wearing a gimp mask.&#x201d;&#x201c;The eyeholes are quite large&#x2014;light had to get in. You have isometric surveillance at all points of entry to this country. Give me a copy of the DVD&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll get our nerds on the case. If they can make a good still of his eyes and enlarge it, it&#x2019;s as good as a fingerprint. Better. Are you going to let me see the body?&#x201d;&#x201c;If you want. But how deeply involved do you want to get?&#x201d;&#x201c;Look, I don&#x2019;t know much, but Chanya told me you&#x2019;re very upset. That touches me too. If I can help, then that&#x2019;s what I want to do.&#x201d;&#x201c;Chanya spilled her guts?&#x201d;&#x201c;She loves you. She hinted that you need a little moral support from a fellow professional. I said okay, I&#x2019;ll do what I can, so long as he lets me in.&#x201d;The FBI has no idea how many points she&#x2019;s accumulated with me for treating a pregnant third-world ex-prostitute as a friend and equal. That kind of heroism leaves us slack-jawed in these parts. Chanya loves her too, of course, and when a Thai girl loves, she tells all.A <i>tuk-tuk</i> passes, spilling black pollution from its two-stroke engine. They used to be a symbol of Thailand: three wheels, a steel roof on vertical struts, and a happy smiling driver. Now they&#x2019;re a tourist gimmick catering to a diminishing number of tourists. So far the new millennium has not delivered much in the way of new; instead we have a certain foreboding that a return to old-fashioned grinding poverty might be our share of globalism. Kimberley hasn&#x2019;t noticed this yet&#x2014;she&#x2019;s been here only two days, and already the work ethic has gripped her. She&#x2019;s not seeing the <i>tuk-tuk</i> or even its pollution.&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to use our guys to copy the DVD,&#x201d; I say. She looks at me. &#x201c;That kind of thing is produced in very limited numbers, sold to a specialized international market.&#x201d; She is still looking at me. I feel blood rising up my neck, into facial blood vessels. &#x201c;This is a poor country.&#x201d; Still the look: I have to come clean. &#x201c;They would sell it.&#x201d;She turns away to save me from her contempt. A couple of beats pass, then briskly: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m okay now. How are you going to copy it?&#x201d;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not. I&#x2019;ll put it in my pocket. You can use the business center at the Grand Britannia to e-mail it straight from the disk.&#x201d;She waits in the public area while I go back to retrieve the disk: five point seven megabytes of distilled evil. Out on the street she pauses to stare at a young monk in his early to mid-twenties. He is tall, and there is an exotic elegance about him incongruous with the Internet caf� he is about to enter.&#x201c;Using the Net is frowned on by the Sangha, especially in public areas, but it&#x2019;s not a serious offense. Often monks use it to check Buddhist websites,&#x201d; I explain, glad to talk about something lighter than a snuff movie.&#x201c;Is he a regular around here? Somehow this doesn&#x2019;t seem like the kind of place a monk would want to hang out.&#x201d; Kimberley feels the need for small talk too.&#x201c;I saw him for the first time yesterday. I don&#x2019;t know which <i>wat</i> he&#x2019;s attached to.&#x201d;</p><h2>Secrets Of High States</h2><p>Known in the investment world as the founder and editor of The Dines Letter, Mr James Dines is truly a living legend.

Da Vinci lived to be 67&#x2014;nearly twice the average life span at the time&#x2014;and his longevity may well have been due to his diet, which is reconstructed here complete with his notes on ingredients, portions, cooking, drinking, and kitchen inventions. The great artist, scientist, and inventor was no slouch in the kitchen, having worked as a kind of theatrical caterer, producing feasts with extravagant menus for royalty. This book unlocks his cooking code and the food history of his day, bringing 30 recipes up to date, including da Vinci's own salad dressing and an exotic saffron risotto with duck and mushrooms fit for a Medici.</p><p><b>Dave Dewitt</b> is the author of more than 30 books, mostly&nbsp;on the subject of&nbsp;chile peppers and spicy foods, including the best-selling <i>The Whole Chile Pepper Book</i>. He lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico.<i>Starred Review.</i> Though it seems the title of this book is a bid to profit by association with a certain global bestseller-the topic of "Leonardo's Larder" takes up just one chapter-it's easy to forgive this well-researched history, a fascinating look into the eating habits of 15th and 16th-century Italy. Delving into formal feasts, foreign crops and the Arabic influence on Italian cooking, Dewitt (The Chile Pepper Encyclopedia) also includes chapters on "The First Superstar Chefs" and what your seat says about you: "honored guests were seated with their backs to the fire ... it was an exercise in social standing ... governed by strict protocol." The author liberally quotes Renaissance food authorities like Platina, an early librarian at the Vatican who wrote what is likely the first printed cookbook. He also references modern food scholars like Waverly Root and Odile Redon, and includes historical recipes for Renaissance favorites like Risi e Bisi and Spinach Soup with Hazelnuts. Detailed and passionate, this book is unlikely to appeal to a broad audience, but for foodies who want an in-depth exploration of the roots of Italian cuisine, one can hardly go wrong here.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The American Meat Institute reports that bacon has an almost cultlike following; the Facebook page About Bacon has more than 10 million Likes. Its sublime savory taste has been endorsed by scientists as well: Bacon boasts umami, the seductive &#x201c;fifth taste&#x201d; that heightens and rises beyond sweet, sour, bitter, and salty. Bacon isn&#x2019;t just an infatuation&#x2015;it&#x2019;s a way of life. In Bacon 24/7, author Theresa Gilliam and photographer E Jane Armstrong have teamed up to create a fun and current cookbook to feed the need for bacon. They include recipes for every hour, from dawn through dark, as well as info on topics such as how to cure and smoke your own bacon. Drool-worthy photographs highlight dishes such as Pasta Carbonara, Pork Belly Hash with Kale and Sweet Potatoes, and Apple Pie with Bacon Strudel.

It&#x2019;s not just with eggs at breakfast or with slices of tomato and lettuce leaves at lunch, but it shows up ubiquitously at meals from morn to midnight and beyond, as Gilliam documents. Truly dedicated bacon fanatics can follow Gilliam&#x2019;s instructions for turning a slab of pork belly into smoky rashers over the course of a week. Those less motivated have dozens of recipes for waffles, salads, soups, sandwiches, appetizers, entr�es, and desserts. Some dishes, such as Alsatian onion tart and spaghetti carbonara, faithfully reproduce classics. Crab and corn chowder would not be out of place on any New England table. On the other hand, Gilliam&#x2019;s transformation of the classic BLT into a cold soup befits a modernist kitchen, and bacon baklava pushes the boundaries of fusion cooking.

The weapon that made him a &#39;Hero of the Soviet Union&#39; has also appeared on t-shirts and vodka bottles, featured in videos and song lyrics and been re-fashioned in crystal - a gift from Putin to George W. Bush. Power, politics and passion combine in the story of a weapon that has shaped the modern world. Using testimonies of people who have experienced the gun at first-hand - including a Sudanese child soldier, a Vietcong veteran, and Yorkshire student - Michael Hodges provides a compelling account of how the AK47 became an icon that ranks alongside Coca-Cola as one of the most recognizable brands in the world.</p><p>Michael Hodges is a journalist from the UK who has reported extensively from the Middle EastStarred Review. Invented by Mikhail Kalashnikov in 1947, the AK47 assault rifle was adopted by the Soviet army, subsequently became "the icon of Third World revolution," and now serves as "the brand leader for international terrorism." In a lively but chilling investigative history, British journalist Hodges examines the legacy of the "most ubiquitous gun in the world." With only eight moving parts, the semi-automatic is cheap, durable and simple to operate, providing 650 rounds-per-minute firepower with minimal training. Communist China supplied them to the North Vietnamese in 1963, where they were better suited for jungle fighting than the U.S. Army's M16; that conflict cemented the AK47's reputation as "the 'anti-imperialist gun,'" a symbol now evoked by Osama bin Laden, who never appears on-camera without one. Today it arms Palestinian resistance fighters and child soldiers in Sudan, as well as schoolyard shooters in the U.S. and Rambo at the movies -a lot to cover, but Hodges knows how to keep his thorough, eye-opening narrative moving, even as he hopscotches to nearly every conflict zone of the past 60 years. Though not for the feint of heart, this pop-history page-turner should appeal to anyone interested in military history or international conflict. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But when Jan discovered water trickling through a desolate stretch of the dike that protected his low-lying village, he knew he had to act fast.</p><p><b>Thomas Locker</b>&nbsp;was one of the major American painters of the past century. In a career that spanned almost 60 years,&nbsp;he had over 75 solo exhibitions. In 1982, he began work on his first children&#x2019;s picture book, <i>Where the River Begins</i>. Mr. Locker&#x2019;s exceptional paintings and illustrations grace the pages of some 30 different books, several of which he also wrote. These unique books have been honored with numerous awards, including the prestigious Christopher Award, the John Burroughs Award, and <i>the New York Times </i>Award for best illustration.<br><b>Lenny Hort </b>is the author of several acclaimed books for children, including <i>The Boy Who Held Back the Sea</i>. Mr. Hort lives in New Jersey with his wife and their three daughters.Kindergarten-Grade 3 Grandmother tells Pieter, who has been sent to his room, the story of The Boy Who Held Back the Sea. Hort's adaptation of a story that appears in Mary Mapes Dodge's Hans Brinker is significantly longer with numerous changes and embellishments. More complex characters have been created, removing the story from the realm of fable and placing it into fiction. Jan is depicted as a troublemaker who tells tales about sea serpents to the dike's watchmen, plays hookey from church, and throws a rock through a school windowa complete opposite from the sunny-haired boy of gentle disposition who reads to a blind man in Hans Brinker. Both, however, become heroes when they observe a hole in the dike and plug it with a finger. Locker's arresting oil paintings, with their dramatic clouds, towering trees, and natural diffused lighting are suggestive of the 17th-Century Dutch landscape paintings made famous by Jacob van Ruisdael. The posed figures and the meticulously depicted objects in the opening and closing scenes are particularly reminiscent of Vermeer. Locker's depiction of nature overpowering humanity is especially significant to the story and to the Dutch people who have spent centuries battling the sea. Karen K.

Averitt Lecture Series)</h2><p>Poetry is philosophically interesting, writes Gerald L. Bruns, "when it is innovative not just in its practices, but, before everything else, in its poetics (that is, in its concepts or theories of itself)." In <i>The Material of Poetry</i>, Bruns considers the possibility that anything, under certain conditions, may be made to count as a poem. By spelling out such enabling conditions he gives us an engaging overview of some of the kinds of contemporary poetry that challenge our notions of what language is: sound poetry, visual or concrete poetry, and "found" poetry.<p>Poetry's sense and meaning can hide in the spaces in which it is written and read, says Bruns, and so he urges us to become anthropologists, to go afield in poetry's social, historical, and cultural settings. From that perspective, Bruns draws on works by such varied poets as Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, Steve McCaffery, and Francis Ponge to argue for three seemingly competing points. First, poetry is made of language but is not a use of it. That is, poetry is made of words but not of what we use words to produce: concepts, narratives, expressions of feeling, and so on. Second, as the nine sound poems on the CD included with the book demonstrate, poetry is not necessarily made of words but is rooted in, and in fact already fully formed by, sounds the human body can produce. Finally, poetry belongs to the world alongside ordinary things; it cannot be confined to some aesthetic, neutral, or disengaged dimension of human culture.</p><p>Poetry without frontiers, unmoored from expectations, and sometimes even written in imaginary languages: Bruns shows us why, for the sake of all poetry, we should embrace its anarchic, vitalizing ways.</p></p><p>Georgia Southern University Jack N. and Addie D.

But Navajo Tribal policeman Jim Chee and his mentor, Joe Leaphorn, discover an even deadlier killer stalking the reservation in the most chilling and beautifully crafted novel yet from the beloved and bestselling master of Southwestern suspense. <p> When Acting Lt. Chee catches a Hopi eagle poacher literally red-handed--huddled over the bloody body of a young Navajo Tribal police officer--he has an open-and-shut case. Even the Feds--usually at odds with Chee'agree, and it seems the Hopi is headed for the gas chamber. Until Joe Leaphorn shows up to blow Chee's case wide open.</p><p> Leaphorn, now retired form the Navajo Tribal Police, has been hired to find Cathy Pollard, a hot-headed biologist who disappeared from the same remote area on the same day the Navajo cop was murdered. Is she a suspect? A victim? And what are Chee and Leaphorn to make of the report that a skinwalker--a Navajo witch--was seen in the same area at the same time? </p><p> To answer these questions, Leaphorn and Chee must immerse themselves in the enigmatic web of scientists hunting the key to the most virulent form of bubonic plague since the Middle Ages. </p><p> In addition to its finely wrought plot, <em>The First Eagle</em> offers a wealth of Tony Hillerman's signature gifts--glorious evocations of the high desert, delicately drawn characters, and eloquent insights into the foibles and wisdom of the Southwest's native people.</p></p><p>It seems like July 8 is going to be a bad day for Acting Lieutenant Jim Chee. He's got a stack of overdue paperwork on his desk. Anderson Nez has died of plague, but the circumstances around the death are murky. His ex-fianc�e, Janet Pete, is returning from Washington, D.C., and Chee doesn't know what to think about her last letter. (Will they be getting married this time?) And Officer Benny Kinsman's unwanted advances have enraged Catherine Pollard (among others), one of the scientists studying this newest outbreak of the black death. Now, the hot-headed Kinsman's gone off to nab a Hopi man who's poaching eagles. When Chee is called to back Kinsman up at Yells Back Butte, the bad day turns worse. He finds the young Hopi, Robert Jano, standing over Benny's mortally wounded body. Jano insists that he did not kill the police officer. Add to all this Joe Leaphorn's separate investigation, also involving July 8. Joe's got a new role as consulting detective to the wealthy--investigating the July 8 disappearance at Yells Back Butte of the same Catherine Pollard who was dogged by Kinsman. <p> This one bad day and the ensuing days of investigation bring Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee together once again as they uncover the secret of Yells Back Butte, plague fleas, and skinwalkers. As usual, Hilllerman's ear for dialogue is remarkable. One does not read Leaphorn and Chee's words and thoughts as much as hear them. While the book invites new readers (little knowledge of the previous books in the series is presumed), one has the sense of entering an old neighborhood where friends and relations are established and emotions run deep. Jim Chee's pain is vivid as he struggles under the shadow of Leaphorn and questions the "rusty trailer" lifestyle that has driven him apart from Janet. Nothing is contrived in his mixture of fear and elation when he and Janet meet again. </p><p> Hillerman has written an engaging novel that once again evokes the land and people of the Southwest while also confronting the cultural separateness of the region from the power centers of the East. Already honored for his previous work (<i>Dance Hall of the Dead</i> received the Edgar), <i>The First Eagle</i> is a welcome addition to the beloved Chee-Leaphorn series that began in 1971 with <i>The Blessing Way</i>. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p><p>Tony Hillerman (1925&#x2013;2008), an Albuquerque, New Mexico, resident since 1963, was the author of 29 books, including the popular 18-book mystery series featuring Navajo police officers Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn, two non-series novels, two children&#x2019;s books, and nonfiction works.

He went to sea early, was sailing to the Spanish Main by 1565, and commanded a ship under Hawkins in an expedition that was overwhelmed by the Spaniards in 1567. Sir Francis Drake (1540 &#x2013; 28 January 1596) was an English sea captain, slave trader, and privateer of the Elizabethan era. Drake carried out the second circumnavigation of the world in a single expedition, from 1577 to 1580, and was the first to complete the voyage as captain while leading the expedition throughout the entire circumnavigation. With his incursion into the Pacific Ocean, he claimed what is now California for the English and inaugurated an era of conflict with the Spanish on the western coast of the Americas, an area that had previously been largely unexplored by western shipping. Elizabeth I awarded Drake a knighthood in 1581. As a Vice Admiral, he was second-in-command of the English fleet in the battle against the Spanish Armada in 1588. He died of dysentery in January 1596, after unsuccessfully attacking San Juan, Puerto Rico. Drake's exploits made him a hero to the English, but his privateering led the Spanish to brand him a pirate, known to them as El Draque. King Philip II allegedly offered a reward for his capture or death of 20,000 ducats about �6 million (US$8 million) in modern currency. Francis Drake was born in Tavistock, Devon, England. Although his birth date is not formally recorded, it is known that he was born while the Six Articles were in force. His birth date is estimated from contemporary sources such as: "Drake was two and twenty when he obtained the command of the Judith" (1566). This would date his birth to 1544. A date of c.1540 is suggested from two portraits: one a miniature painted by Nicholas Hilliard in 1581 when he was allegedly 42, so born circa 1539, while the other, painted in 1594 when he was said to be 53, would give a birth year of around 1541. He was the eldest of the twelve sons of Edmund Drake (1518&#x2013;1585), a Protestant farmer, and his wife Mary Mylwaye. The first son was alleged to have been named after his godfather Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford. Because of religious persecution during the Prayer Book Rebellion in 1549, the Drake family fled from Devonshire into Kent. There Drake's father obtained an appointment to minister the men in the King's Navy. He was ordained deacon and was made vicar of Upnor Church on the Medway. Francis Drake's father apprenticed him to his neighbour, the master of a barque used for coastal trade transporting merchandise to France. The ship's master was so satisfied with the young Francis Drake's conduct that, being unmarried and childless at his death, he bequeathed the barque to Drake.</p><p></p><h2>Unfinished Journey</h2><p>Physical description: xvii, 393 p., [48] p. of plates : music, ports. ; 24 cm.

Well-known collections were made by enthusiasts as diverse as the French aristocrat Baron J�r�me Davillier (1815-1890), whose collection included the ring of the Black Prince found in the ruins of the Castle of Montpensier in 1866, and C. D. Fortnum (1820-1899) whose income came from the famous grocery store in Piccadilly. Rings can take us back through time, illuminating vanished worlds and bringing their former owners back to life. Some rings are intensely personal, particularly wedding and mourning rings, while others denote the status of their owners: monarchs, nobles, those high in the hierarchy of the church and rich merchants, amongst others.</p><p>Sandra Hindman is professor emerita of art history at Northwestern University.</p><h2>Breakfast at Danny&#39;s Diner: A Book About Multiplication, (All aboard math reader)</h2><p>When Danny&#39;s niece and nephew, twins Tina and Tony, help out at the diner, they need to put their multiplication skills to work to make the breakfast rush run smoothly.

Sayers created aristocratic sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey. Though best known for her entertaining crime novels, the lively minded Sayers also wrote plays, poetry and essays on Christianity. <br><br> <p>Dorothy L. Sayers, the greatest of the golden age detective novelists, was born in Oxford in 1893. She was one of the first women to be awarded a degree by Oxford University and worked as a copywriter in an advertising agency from 1921 to 1932. Her aristocratic detective, Lord Peter Wimsey, became one of the most popular fictional heroes of the twentieth century. Dorothy L. Sayers also became famous for her religious plays, notably <i>The Man Born to be King</i>, which was broadcast controversially during the war years, but she considered her translation of Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i> to be her best work. She died in 1957. </p>Ian Carmichael personified Lord Peter Wimsey for a generation of public television viewers. His affection for the brainy, finicky, aristocratic detective is clear in this reading. In addition to creating a well-drawn Wimsey, he imbues solid Bunter with the humor and patience that Sayers blended into his personality. All the other characters in this tale of countryside bell ringing gone wrong are so perfectly vivid that listeners may find themselves chortling with pleasure as they listen. The only quibble is that Carmichael's reading voice is the same as the one he gives to Lord Peter, leading to some confusion between the narrative and the dialogue spoken by Wimsey. But no matter, this is still a long evening's pleasure.

Visit her online at www.melissadarnell.com.<br><br>SAVANNAH<br><br>I stared at the surrounding forest on Rich Mountain, one hand braced against the trunk of a leafless hardwood tree at my side, my too-quick breaths making puffs of fog in the afternoon air as the feeble sun edged beneath the winter-stripped branches of the tree line. The air was smoky, acrid with the false promise of comfort from the chimney of a cabin several yards behind me, which I was struggling to ignore during my few blessed minutes of solitude outside.<br><br>It should have been perfect.... Tristan and me and a remote log cabin with a crackling fireplace nestled on a west Arkansas mountain in December. No Clann or vampire council nearby to bother us. No more rules or secrets to keep us apart. No more risk of accidentally draining and killing Tristan with a kiss.<br><br>Instead, it was all wrong, and I was staggering under the weight of what we now faced.<br><br>We weren't alone here. My dad had come along, not for Tristan's safety or even my own, but for anyone else who might come too close and trigger the bloodlust within Tristan. If not for Dad's holding him back last night, Tristan might have slaughtered his own family in the Circle, the Clann's clearing and primary meeting place in our hometown woods where so much Clann and vamp blood had been shed only hours ago.<br><br>Just the memory of how Tristan had looked there&#x2014;his once soft emerald eyes turned white-silver with need, his normally full lips stretched thin and baring newly formed fangs as he snarled with rage&#x2014;forced a shudder to ripple through my body. Until that moment, I'd never seen a vampire lose control to the bloodlust. Now that I had, I would never forget it.<br><br>Coming to this isolated cabin hadn't been optional, and staying here promised to be anything but fun or peaceful. We'd had to load up Dad's car last night and come here immediately after the battle in the Circle just to get Tristan away from all humans before the bloodlust drove him crazy. Even stopping for gas had been a nightmare. Thank heavens Jacksonville, our East Texas hometown, was only a day's drive, so we hadn't been forced to stop often. Now that Tristan was a full vampire, his strength was far beyond my own thanks to his years of playing football and strength training before being turned. The one time we had stopped, I'd had to fill the gas tank so that Dad could hold Tristan inside the car and away from the humans in the gas station.<br><br>And afterward, the new mind connection had made it all so much worse, allowing Tristan to pick up my every thought while I silently struggled not to freak out.<br><br>Before I had turned Tristan, the ESP between us had been a one-way street and I hadn't had to worry about his hearing my every thought. Because vampires and Clann were natural-born enemies, mental blocks had evolved in both the vamp and Clann species so that neither side could read the others' minds. But because I was a dhampir&#x2014;born from a human mother and a vampire father&#x2014;I could read both sides' minds yet was shielded from their reading mine.<br><br>Unfortunately now that Tristan was half Clann and half vampire like me, we suddenly had zero trouble reading each other's every thought. This would have been great if there had been some sort of off switch to the ability. But for now, at least, there didn't seem to be one, turning the new ability into more of a curse. The only way we could block each other's thoughts was to be in separate rooms. Walls with closed doors and windows between us thankfully seemed to cut off our brain waves from each other.<br><br>It used to make me feel so alone, this ability to read but not be read by all the open minds around me. But now that Tristan had become the one person on this planet who could read my every thought as soon as it formed, I realized how spoiled I'd become by having the freedom to think anything I wanted. I had no idea how to discipline the panicked, guilty chaos inside my head while around him. And because of my lack of mental self-control, I was hurting him over and over.<br><br>Which was why, after Tristan had fallen asleep inside the cabin still hurt and confused by my reaction to him at the gas station, I'd snuck out here to the woods to catch a breath. And to finally give in to the thousand and one worries I had fought so hard not to think when he was awake.<br><br>What had I done to him? To us?<br><br>I wrapped an arm around a nearby tree and leaned against it, allowing it to hold me up. I was so tired, but my mind refused to shut off and let me rest.<br><br>The cabin door creaked out in warning, and another chunk of tree bark crumbled under my fingers as I twisted to look back over my shoulder.<br><br>Dad walked over to join me, and my shoulders sagged under a wave of relief. I'd almost forgotten that I wasn't alone in this. Thank God I had Dad to turn to for advice on how to train a fledgling, because I was completely clueless here.<br><br>"Come to get some fresh mountain air?" he said.<br><br>"No. Just...needing some space to worry about Tristan. He can hear my every thought now, whether I want him to or not. But he doesn't remember anything except the memories he got from my blood. He's so lost and confused, and he doesn't understand why I'm freaking out." My voice was rising. I took a breath and struggled to bring it down to a murmur so Tristan wouldn't hear us. "How are we going to tell him about everything?"<br><br>Dad had said the biggest danger for all fledglings was in the first few months after they'd turned, when the human mind struggled to adjust to the vampire DNA. During this phase, he said the brain tended to react as if after a concussion, shutting off the memory center and operating solely on the baser levels of senses and instincts. The memory would return in time, but it could take several months.<br><br>In the meantime, Tristan might be highly emotional and possibly even irrational sometimes, and it would be hard for him to concentrate for long periods of time. In addition, he would have the impulse to feed on humans with no understanding of why he felt such cravings, and he'd have the speed, strength and reflexes of a full vampire.<br><br>"We cannot attempt to hasten the recovery of his memories in any way," Dad said. "We must be patient and allow his memories to return to him on their own. Telling him what he has forgotten will only stress and confuse him still further. He will never truly believe what he does not remember himself, and right now he is in much too volatile a state to handle all the ramifications of our current situation. You will have to continue to protect him from your thoughts as much as you are able to."<br><br>Easier said than done.<br><br>"What if he never remembers it all? What if I'm not strong enough, or smart enough, or we don't train him right or fast enough...?"<br><br>Dad rested a hand on my shoulder. "Now you know all that I have gone through with you. Becoming responsible for another's continued existence is the heaviest responsibility there is. But it does grow easier with time."<br><br>Time. How much did we even have? "Will the council try to find us out here?"<br><br>He shook his head. "They trust me to be truthful in my reports to them by phone. The Clann, however..."<br><br>I frowned in confusion. "Tristan's mom is leading them now. Why would they be a problem?"<br><br>"We both know how she feels about our kind."<br><br>And Nancy Coleman blamed me for turning her only son into the very thing she feared the most in life.<br><br>"Okay, so she might hate my guts," I said. "But if she'd wanted to take me out, she could have done it last night in the Circle."<br><br>"With such a mixed audience of both Clann and vampire councilmen present?"<br><br>Hmm. I saw his point. A chill spread over my skin. "Still, she's Tristan's mom. She knows he needs me to help train him now."<br><br>"Unless she decides you and Tristan are too great a threat to the Clann after all. Especially now that you have proven your blood can turn descendants where no other vampire's has been able to before."<br><br>My stomach twisted. I took a slow and careful breath. "She wouldn't do that. Not to her own son. She adores Tristan, no matter what I've turned him into."<br><br>"For all our sakes, let us hope you are right. Let us also hope that she gains control over the Clann quickly before any descendants can decide to take matters into their own hands and seek retribution against you for turning their leader."<br><br>"Tristan was only their leader for about two minutes."<br><br>"Even still, he was their leader. And now he is cast out and all but dead to them. You turned him into that which they fear above all else in this world. It is not likely that they will forget that fact soon."<br><br>I stared at the seemingly endless miles of surrounding woods now turning to shades of gray in the fast growing dusk. "Even if the Clann comes after us, they can't find us out here. We didn't leave a trail, and no one knows about this place. Right?"<br><br>"They do not have to know about it. If the Clann is determined to find us, the odds are in their favor that they will. Do not forget, they have both spells and the Keepers to aid them."<br><br>Oh, lord. I had forgotten about the Clann's alliance with the Keepers, a group of families also originally from Ireland who, in the old country, had agreed to have a shapeshifter spell placed upon them that spanned generations. Once they shifted into the form of giant black panthers, the Keepers could read both Clann and vampire minds, including mine and probably still Tristan's, too. My best friend's boyfriend, Ron Abernathy, was one of a long line of Keepers.<br><br>Could the Clann force Ron and his family to help them hunt us?<br><br>I swallowed against a growing knot in my throat. We were buried deep in the woods two states away from the Clann's Jacksonville headquarters. How would the Keepers scent us down&#x2014;by following the smell of our car exhaust?<br><br>"I took every precaution possible during our trip," Dad said. "And we will stay away from the surrounding towns to lessen the humans' knowledge of our presence here. Nevertheless, we must remain cautious. If you sense any sort of magic being used, you must let me know at once. They may try to use a spell to track us down if they become truly determined."<br><br>Oh, great. I hadn't thought of that, either.<br><br>Like all Clann descendants, I had the ability to feel when magic was being used nearby. It would hit me as a sensation of pins and needles stabbing the back of my neck and arms. But I was still new to using my Clann abilities and, as an outcast of the Clann since before my birth, I was also completely self-taught. There was so much I didn't know about magic. How far away could it be used on someone? Would I feel that spell if the user was physically far away from me?<br><br>Then I remembered who I was talking to and froze.<br><br>Both the Clann and the vampire council had demanded my mother and grandmother never teach me how to use magic. But I'd broken that rule and secretly learned how to anyway. Until last night, I'd worked especially hard to keep my growing Clann abilities a secret from my dad, because the vampire council could read his every thought.<br><br>This was the first time Dad had openly acknowledged he knew I could use magic.<br><br>He must have seen me throwing defensive spells last night in the Circle. The council members probably had seen it, too. During the heat of the battle while blocking and returning spells, hiding my new abilities had been the absolute last thing on my mind.<br><br>I didn't know whether to be relieved that my final secret was out, or even more worried. "Has the council said anything to you about my new...um, skills?"<br><br>He shook his head, his mouth set in a grim line. "I suspect they are waiting to see how Tristan's training turns out first. It would not be strategically wise of them to risk upsetting the only two vampires in the world who also have magical abilities, especially when one of them is currently so unstable and the treaty with the Clann is in question. But eventually I do expect them to call both of you in for...a discussion."<br><br>Great. The last time the council had summoned me to their headquarters in Paris, they'd kidnapped Tristan and used him to test my ability to resist the bloodlust for Clann blood, the most powerful temptation to any vamp alive. I'd passed the test, but barely.<br><br>I had zero desire to see how a ticked-off, newly turned Tristan would react to facing the council in their headquarters.<br><br>I pressed a shaky hand to my pounding temple. One crisis at a time. First we had to stabilize Tristan, make it safe for him to be around others again. Then we'd deal with the council.<br><br>"So about Tristan's training," I said. "You've got a plan, right?"<br><br>"Not exactly."<br><br>I turned to stare at him. "You're joking, right? You're over three hundred years old. You've probably trained tons of fledglings by now."<br><br>"You are my only fledgling still alive."<br><br>"What happened to the ones who came before me?"<br><br>"There was only one. In the first hundred years of my immortal life, Gowin was busy with his many other fledglings and I became lonely and disillusioned by my existence. I foolishly attempted to turn a dying friend so that I might have a companion, someone to speak with about our unique trials and tribulations."<br><br>My heartbeat raced. "What happened?"<br><br>"I failed to help him overcome the initial hurdle of the bloodlust."<br><br>"So the council...?"<br><br>"My fledgling was out of control despite my best efforts, and ultimately I could not argue with the council's decision to put him down."<br><br>Put him down?<br><br>Oh. He meant they'd <em>killed</em> his first fledgling.<br><br>And since I was a dhampir instead of a full vamp, my version of training probably didn't count toward Dad's true track record as a vamp sire. Which meant Dad didn't know what he was doing, either.<br><br>"Why do y'all have to call it that?" I whispered, trying not to picture Tristan facing the council's wrath if Dad and I failed to teach him self-control. "They're not animals to be 'put down.' They're people."<br><br>"When the council decides to end a fledgling's existence, believe me, it is not because that fledgling is exhibiting any higher form of civilized traits. They <em>are</em> animals, driven by nothing other than the base need to feed. 'Putting them down' is the only apt way to describe it. It is an act of compassion made with the understanding that the person that fledgling once was can never be brought back in any shape or form, thus hopefully saving both the fledgling's soul along with all the souls of the lives they would otherwise take from this world."<br><br>I stared at my dad, sensing both the quick buzzing quality of his emotions in the air between us and hearing his thoughts. I'd never seen him so wound up like this, both afraid and desperate and ashamed all at the same time. Ashamed of his previous failure, fearful that we would fail again and this time it would be <em>my</em> fledgling who would face the council's ultimate punishment.<br><br>But my dad was a three-hundred-year-old vamp and a former member of the council. He was supposed to have all the answers.<br><br></p><h2>Sparrow Hawk Red</h2><p>Thirteen-year-old Ricky, the Mexican American son of a former Drug Enforcement Agency man, tries to avenge his mother&#39;s murder by crossing over into Mexico to steal a high-tech radar plane from drug smugglers.</p><p>Ben Mikaelsen is the award-winning author of many books for children, including<em>Petey</em>, <em>Countdown</em>, <em>Rescue Josh McGuire</em>, <em>Stranded</em>, and<em>Sparrow Hawk Red</em>. He lives in Bozeman, Montana.Grade 6-8-- As in Rescue Josh McGuire (Hyperion, 1991), Mikaelsen aptly describes a 13-year-old boy's emotional response to an appalling event. Ricky Diaz, the son of an ex-Drug Enforcement Agency pilot, vows to avenge the death of his mother, an innocent victim of the international drug war. When he overhears his father refuse a secret mission to confiscate the Skyhawk, a Mexican drug cartel's plane (equipped with radar stolen from the DEA), Ricky decides to do it himself. Spanish-speaking and confident in his ability to fly small aircraft, he heads for the border. Once across, he lives among the rateros (homeless children) and meets Soledad, a streetwise waif who shares not only survival tips, but also strategies for penetrating the high-security cartel compound. Ultimately Ricky accomplishes his goal, but not without the last minute intervention of his father. Although the plot is far-fetched, many aspects of the novel ring true. The characterization is strong, the depiction of street life realistic, and the theme timely. This fast-paced tale should appeal to a varied audience, including reluctant readers. --Pat Katka, San Diego Public Library<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Evil Paradises: Dreamworlds of Neoliberalism</h2><p><b>Eclectic thinkers, brought together by the bestselling author of <i>City of Quartz</i>, meditate on future worlds being created by unfettered capitalism.</b><br><br><i>"Not content with existing offshore tax shelters, multi-millionaires and property developers have aspired to build their own....To defeat the predatory outreach of nations and tides, it is clearly not enough to be offshore: true freedom floats."</i>&#x2014;from "Floating Utopias" by China Mi�ville<br><br><i>Evil Paradises</i>, edited by Mike Davis and Daniel Bertrand Monk, is a global guidebook to phantasmagoric but real places&#x2014;alternate realities being constructed as "utopias" in a capitalist era unfettered by unions and state regulation.

He lives in San Diego. Daniel Bertrand Monk is the director of the Peace Studies Program at Colgate University and the author of An Aesthetic Occupation. He lives in Hamilton, New York.In the evil paradises of this uneven anthology edited by scholars Davis and Monk, the free market coddles the wealthy at the expense of everyone else. With contributions from academics, architects and journalists, the essays explore how cities like Beijing and Johannesburg disregard good governance for prestige projects adored by the nomadic business elite. Though the message is consistent, the tone wanders from a fun and flimsy piece on Orange County by journalist Rebecca Schoenkopf to history professor Jon Wiener's overly somber look at Ted Turner's two million&#x2013;acre landholding. In one essay, Davis launches a salvo at Dubai, distilling the glittering emirate into Milton Friedman's Beach Club, powered by the labor of imported near-slaves. California-style gated housing developments are a recurring theme, popping up in Iran and Hong Kong. More original is science fiction novelist China Mi�ville's brilliant essay Floating Utopias about a seafaring metropolis and tax haven to dwarf the largest ocean liner. The catch? This libertarian dream project will probably never be built because that philosophy, Mi�ville explains, is for people too small, incompetent or insufficiently connected to avoid taxes or, for that matter, to build a boat equipped with an airport. Even when it's not so pithy, this leftist world tour reminds us of development's human cost. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But long ago, on Iberian soil, they were the magisters of their people, and the leaven of Mediterranean civilization altogether. Such were the Sephardim, and in Moslem Andalusia they were renowned prime ministers and army commanders, distinguished scientists, belletrists, and religious scholars. In Christian Spain and Provence, their translators ignited Europe's twelfth-century renaissance, their revenue agents funded the economies of Aragon and Castile, and their astronomers and navigators plotted the explorations of Christopher Columbus and Vasco da Gama.<br><br>From the late fifteenth century onward, in exile from their Spanish and Portuguese homelands, the Sephardim made their mark as viziers and intimate advisers of Ottoman sultans, as vastly esteemed physicians of Renaissance dukes and popes, and as dynamic importers and exporters in the Dutch maritime traffic. Whether as professing Jews or converted "New Christians," it was this protean minority that functioned as a self-contained international trading network, spanning the seas and oceans, pioneering the gem industry of Europe and the sugar and tobacco plantations of Brazil, and flourishing as merchant ship captains amid pirate-infested Caribbean waterways.<br><br>Farewell Espana transcends conventional historical narrative. With the lucidity and verve that have characterized his numerous earlier volumes, Howard Sachar breathes life into the leading dramatis personae of the Sephardic world: the royal counselors Samuel ibn Nagrela and Joseph Nasi, the poets Solomon ibn Gabirol and Judah Halevi, the philosophers Moses Maimonides and Baruch Spinoza, the statesmen Benjamin Disraeli and Pierre Mendes-France, the warriors Moshe Pijade and David Elazar, the fabulous charlatans David Reuveni and Shabbatai Zvi.<br><br>In its breadth and richness of texture, Sachar's account sweeps to the contemporary era of Mussolini, Hitler, and Franco, poignantly traces the fate of Balkan Sephardic communities during the Holocaust -- and their revival in the Land and State of Israel.

We thought that many of our readers might approach a new book the way we do -- by skipping the miscellaneous pages and jumping right into the good stuff! But the information in this brief section is too important to gloss over. It will help answer some of the questions you may have as you go along. </p><p> Over two years ago, we sat on a porch swing and shared our vision for this book. Our original ideas took the form of a three page outline which became our framework throughout the writing process. Many long days and countless revisions later, our original <i>Porch Swing Planning</i> session evolved into the book you are about to read. </p><p> During the writing process, our vision changed little from our original outline. The chapter you are reading now is the only addition. We chose to add this section to share with our readers the underlying philosophy that guided our writing and the decisions we made regarding the book's format. </p><p> In the Introduction, we explained our goal of writing a book an ADD adult could use to understand and manage her disorder. We wanted this book to be practical and easy to read for anyone with specific reading and language deficits. To that end, we chose an informal writing style and worked hard to minimize the complexity of some rather complicated scientific concepts. We also included numerous cartoons to make the text more understandable. </p><p> We would like to comment on the organization of this book before you begin reading the three chapters that follow and question what we just said about ease of reading! During the editing process, we agonized over these early chapters that aren't as easy to read as the rest of the book. They are densely packed with rather technical information that is difficult to simplify. We didn't want to lose readers who might react in one or more of the following ways: 1. "Have I been tricked? Is this a text book? I thought it was going to be a practical, self-help book!" 2. "I've already read this information in several other books." 3. "How is this book going to help me if I can't understand the first chapter?" </p><p> We considered a variety of options from eliminating some of the information to reorganizing the format. We concluded that none of the options would solve the problem. We knew that our readers would have varying levels of knowledge about ADD and that some would need an in-depth introduction to the disorder. We were also keenly aware of the curiosity of ADDers who don't often accept suggestions without first asking, "But why?" We decided that without this background information, the anecdotes and practical suggestions that followed wouldn't make much sense. So we chose to leave the format alone and to offer the following guidelines. </p><p> If you've already done extensive reading in ADD, you might want to just browse these chapters. If you're new to ADD, just hang in there with the early chapters, taking them at your own pace and allowing time to digest the material. If you get really bored or befuddled, take a break! We promise the going will get easier and later chapters will take a look at the lighter, more practical side of ADD. </p><p> We also want to explain how we deal with the issue of sexist language in this book. The seeming erratic use of "he" and "she" isn't an editing error! We chose to alternate the use of male and female pronouns by chapters. As you will discover as you read this book, ADD isn't just a problem for boys and men. The assumption that the majority of ADDers are male has been challenged as knowledge about ADD has grown. Since this book is for all of you, men and women alike, we wanted to make the language as inclusive as possible. So, the odd numbered chapters use female pronoun references and the even chapters, male. By the way, there is no significance, other than a flip of a coin, for beginning with <i>she</i> instead of <i>he!</i> Paralleling this issue of sexist language, we have also tried to avoid stereotypes, including examples of both men and women in non-traditional roles. This seems appropriate, particularly since ADDers tend to be rather non-traditional folk. </p><p> Finally, we want to include a word of caution. In reviewing the book, a nationally known ADD expert raised an important issue. He voiced his concern that every adult who read it could identify with the described ADD behaviors and make a self-diagnosis of ADD. This concern is valid. In our work with classroom teachers, many report that the manifestations of ADD characterize every child in their classrooms! </p><p> We want to emphasize that ADD is a complicated syndrome with diverse symptoms of varying degrees of severity. It isn't surprising that educators observe ADD behaviors in many of their students because the symptoms of ADD are an exaggeration of behaviors and experiences that fall within the normal human range. Anyone can sometimes have lapses in memory, act impulsively or have difficulty concentrating. The problem with ADD is one of degree and persistence of the symptoms over time and across varying situations. ADDers have symptoms that begin in childhood and cause significant problems in school, work and relationships. </p><p> Another part of the diagnostic dilemma is that various mental health problems have symptoms that overlap those of ADD. For example, people with schizophrenia or depression have information processing problems similar to ADD adults but often to a greater degree. Virtually all mental health problems interfere with organization and information processing. So, it's not hard to imagine ADD becoming the new bandwagon everyone wants to jump on. We can picture the consternation of mental health professionals confronted with offices filled with people demanding treatment for the ADD they've self-diagnosed. </p><p> We can't emphasize enough that a diagnosis is not a <i>do-it-yourself</i> enterprise. A person with schizophrenia, for example, might have attention deficits but her treatment would be radically different from that of an ADDer. Using stimulant medication in her treatment would likely have the effect of dramatically worsening her condition. The point is, an accurate diagnosis is an essential component of treatment. </p><p> This book isn't a scholarly, diagnostic manual. Several excellent books of that kind are available and are listed in the appendix. If you're reading this book because you suspect you have ADD, follow the guidelines in Chapter 6. Develop a relationship with a professional who can provide a formal evaluation and diagnosis. </p><p> We don't believe, however, that an official ADD diagnosis is a prerequisite for reading this book. Individuals with other mental health problems and those without symptoms sufficiently severe to be considered ADD, can benefit from some of this material. Many of the self-help strategies are useful with or without a specific diagnosis. For example, a reader doesn't have to know why she is disorganized to benefit from some of our suggestions in Chapter 13. In addition, we hope that spouses, friends and colleagues of ADDers and other adults who struggle with related problems will read this book and develop greater sensitivity to individuals with special needs. We can all benefit from understanding how glitches in brain processes can wreak havoc in the daily lives of many people. </p><p> Finally, we hope that you'll find this book enjoyable and informative. If our readers have half as much fun reading it as we have had writing it, we will have accomplished our mission. We welcome your comments, personal experiences or anything else you would like to share with us. </p><p> Sincerely,<br> <i>Kate Kelly and Peggy Ramundo</i> </p><p> Copyright � 1993 by Kate Kelly and Peggy Ramundo</p></p><h2>New Practice Readers Book F</h2><p>1997 New Practice Readers Book F Third Edition (P) by Donald G. Anderson ***ISBN-13: 9780791521229 ***Pages: 186</p><p></p><h2>Hawaiian Folk Tales: A Collection of Native Legends</h2><p>This collection of Hawaiian folk tales is fascinating reading for anyone interested in folklore.</p><p>Hawaii&#39;s mystical past lives in the Battle of the Owls, the transformation of the pig-man Kamapuaa, the strifes of the demon-god Maui, the diminutive Menehune, and the legendary healers of old. Using the Hawaiian language sources of David Malo and Samuel Kamakau, Thrum was among the first to popularize island folk tales. First published in 1907, this collection brings together a series of legends printed in The Hawaiian Annual that included other noted folklorists of the time such as Emerson, Forbes, Gibson, Hyde, Nakuina, and Poepoe. These tales perpetuate the beauty and mystery of Hawaiian sacred tradition serving as an excellent first introduction to the myths, legends, and folk tales that once bound people and the spirit realm in a cosmic unity of purpose.Thomas G. Thrum (1842 - 1932)</p><h2>Explorations in Communication an Anthology</h2><p>This anthology includes twenty-four articles from Explorations, a journal on communication published between 1953 and 1959 and edited by Edmund Carpenter and Marshall McLuhan. Among them are four by Marshall McLuhan, one by Edmund Carpenter, and others by Ray Birdwhistell on kinesics and communication, by Northrop Frye on the language of poetry, by S. Giedion on prehistoric art, and by David Riesman on the oral and written traditions, in addition to essays by Robert Graves, Stanley Edgar Hyman, Gilbert Seldes, Daisetz T. Suzuki, and others.</p><p></p><h2>Kaspar Hauser: Where did he come from?</h2><p>The mysterious circumstances surrounding the life and death of Kaspar Hauser still raise questions today. Born into the aristocratic house of Baden, then imprisoned and cut off from all human contact as a child, in 1828 Kaspar appeared on the streets of Nuremberg at the age of fifteen, incoherent and underdeveloped. He went on to display great purity and spiritual maturity during the short time he spent in the company of others, until his brutal murder at the age of twenty-one. <br><br> Who was this young man who spent almost all of his childhood in isolation? Why was he locked away? Where did his life begin? In the last month of his life, Rudolf Steiner identified the matter of Kaspar Hauser&#x2019;s origin as one of the great questions of history. In this fascinating book, Terry Boardman conducts a phenomenological and historical enquiry into Steiner&#x2019;s question and tries to answer it mostly in terms of Kaspar&#x2019;s spiritual origin and less in terms of his genetic roots. <br><br> Kaspar Hauser&#x2019;s life represents a moving triumph of the human spirit over darkness and adversity, which has both historical and contemporary relevance. The text, along with powerful and provocative illustrations by David Newbatt, offers an interpretation of the phenomena surrounding the life of Kaspar Hauser while shedding light on his spiritual origin and mission. <br><br> This book is an important addition to the literature on the mysterious figure of Kaspar Hauser.</p><p><b>Terry M.

Alice finds this advice ridiculous. But don't almost all of us, at some time or another, engage in magical thinking? Seventy percent of Americans believe in angels; 13 percent of British scientists "touch wood"; 40 percent of Americans believe that astrology is scientific. And that is only the beginning.<br><br> In <em>Six Impossible Things Before Breakfast</em>, Lewis Wolpert tackles one of the most important causes on the horizon of public debate: the nature of belief. Looking at belief's psychological basis and its possible evolutionary origins in physical cause and effect, Wolpert expertly investigates what science can tell us about those concepts we are so sure of, covering everything from everyday beliefs that give coherence to our experiences, to religious beliefs, to paranormal beliefs for which there is no evidence.</p><p>Lewis Wolpert is Professor Emeritus of Biology as Applied to Medicine at University College, London. His books include Six Impossible Things before Breakfast, How We Live and Why We Die, and Malignant Sadness, the basis for a BBC television series.Why do we avoid walking under ladders or breaking mirrors? Why do many people believe that illness is related to wrongdoing? Wolpert, a professor of biology as applied to medicine at University College, London, attempts to answer these and other questions in his marvelously funny and provocative study of the nature of belief. He argues that our beliefs&#x2014;whether everyday ones or religious ones&#x2014;offer fundamental explanations of the causes and effects of events. Our beliefs thus become a way of guiding our actions as well as a means of judging others' actions. Taking a page from evolutionary psychology, the author contends that belief has its origin in the human development of language and of tools and their uses. Once our early ancestors made the connection between certain causes and effects&#x2014;such as a flint causing fire&#x2014;their discoveries led to other cause-and-effect beliefs. Wolpert also discusses how brain abnormalities, hypnosis and psychedelic drugs can lead to false beliefs, and he concludes that religious belief sometimes falls into this category. While he doesn't discount religious belief, Wolpert says that science offers the most reliable beliefs about how the world works. Wolpert's reflections ask us to reconsider how we look at the world every day. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

At the heart of Susan Jeffers&#39;s exquisite picture book lies the idea that in her imagination, a child can journey anywhere and do anything-even fly through the stars on her very own pony.</p><p>Susan Jeffers effortlessly captures the grace and magic of horses in this luminous picture book. Ms. Jeffers is a New York Times best-selling artist, who received a Caldecott Honor for her work on <i>Three Jovial Huntsmen</i>. She is also the illustrator of Margaret Wise Brown's <i>Love Songs of the Little Bear</i>, and the best-selling McDuff series by Rosemary Wells. Susan Jeffers also wrote and illustrated a new pony picture book, <em>My Chincoteague Pony.</em>K-Gr. 2. In this partly autobiographical picture book, Jeffers recounts the story of a young unnamed girl who dreams of having a pony. Her parents explain that ponies are expensive and require a great deal of space, but the child's longing doesn't go away. To compensate, the girl begins drawing a pony, Silver, who comes to life, spiriting the child on a fantasy ride--cantering to join a herd of horses, galloping through a mountain stream, and finally flying back through the night sky to the girl's bedroom. Jeffers' signature artwork captures the imaginative tone of the story, and the fantasy scenes are reminiscent of her earlier work with single-volume fairy tales, such as <i>Hansel and Gretel</i> (1980). In a note, Jeffers explains her own love of horses and art, which began as a child and continues even now.

Original.</p><p>PENTHOUSE magazine has hailed Rick Mofina, a former newspaper crime reporter, as &#34;one of the leading thriller writers of the day.&#34; His books have drawn praise from New York Times Bestselling authors, James Patterson, Michael Connelly, Dean Koontz and Sandra Brown. His series featuring San Francisco reporter Tom Reed and SFPD Homicide Inspector Walt Sydowski, feature the titles, If Angels Fall, Cold Fear, No Way Back, Be Mine, and Blood of Others, which won the Arthur Ellis Award for Best Novel.THE DYING HOUR Chapter One <p>Karen Harding had to get away. She was alone, driving from Seattle north on Interstate 5, wipers slapping at the rain as she tried to understand why her fianc� was suddenly forcing her to make a life-changing decision. Karen brushed her tears away. Why was he doing this? Luke&#x2019;s change of heart had staggered her. She needed to leave for a few days. To think. After they spoke she threw some things into a bag, tossed it into her Toyota and set off to see her big sister Marlene who lived in Vancouver. Karen didn&#x2019;t bother calling ahead. This was an emergency. Besides, Marlene would be home. She and her husband rarely left town because of their two kids and their jobs. The air horn of a Freightliner yanked Karen&#x2019;s attention back to the highway. Her windshield was a watery curtain. Lights from oncoming traffic stabbed at her from the darkness. Big rigs trailed blinding spray as they passed, their wakes nearly swamping her. Time for a break. She exited at a truck stop outside of Bellingham. A massive map of Washington and British Columbia covered the lobby wall. Below it, a corkboard papered with ads for trucks, bonding agents and driving jobs. Faces of missing children, women and fugitive men stared at her from posters. Video games beeped and ponged next to the soda and snack machines. She was hungry. In the restaurant, country music mingled with the aroma of deep-fried food, coffee and the clink of cutlery. Amid the murmur of weary men in ballcaps, plaid shirts and jeans, Karen searched for a seat. She walked by a woman and a young girl laughing over ice-cream, a white-haired couple sharing soft conversation over soup, then a bearded man who wore dark glasses and the white collar of a reverend. He was sitting alone reading a book and sipping coffee. She found a booth by the window and ordered a chicken sandwich. Wind-driven rain bled against the glass. As Karen resumed wrestling with her problem, the truck stop&#x2019;s electrical power surged. The lights flickered. Karen glanced around the diner. The reverend was watching her. He offered a warm smile. Karen tried smiling but looked away. She ached to talk to her sister, to someone who might offer guidance when she was struck by an idea. Maybe the fact a reverend was nearby was a sign. Perhaps she could talk to him. Could she confide her dilemma to a stranger? She looked to his booth but he was gone. Karen noticed the tip left by his coffee cup as the truckers&#x2019; conversations grew louder. Those who were talking on cell phones began alerting the others to trouble arising from the storm, a wreck at the border crossing near Blaine. "A reefer and a loaded tanker," one of them said. "Going to push your wait time way, way back. A couple of hours." Not good. Karen needed to reach her sister tonight. She looked at her folded map for an alternative entry into Canada. She&#x2019;d always crossed at Blaine. She examined the web of roads in Washington&#x2019;s northwest corner. Lynden looked easy enough. Exit northbound on Route 539 at the north end of Bellingham, straight shot to the border. If Lynden was choked, she&#x2019;d try Sumas. </p><p>The storm was unrelenting.</p></p><h2>Senso: And Other Stories (Decadence from Dedalus)</h2><p>Boito's stories combined decadence, the macabre, the demonic and depraved female heroines. They were an immediate and popular success in fin de siecle Italy. Visconti's film of Senso brought Boito's work international recognition. This selection includes his most celebrated novelle, including A Corpse, the bizarre tale of rivalry between an artist and a student of anatomy for the beautiful body of Carlotta, the<br><br>artist's dead mistress</p><p>Camillo Boito (1836-1914) became Professor of Architecture at the Accademia delle Belle Arti while only 19 before moving to Milan to be Professor of Architecture at the Accademia di Brera. Most of his work as an architect was in restoring major buildings to their former glory. He wrote only 17 novelle which were published in periodicals but later published in two volumes in 1876 and 1883. The Dedalus collection Senso (and other stories) is a selection from these two volumes. Boito&#39;s brother, Arrigo was a notable poet and Verdi&#39;s librettist for Otello and Falstaff.</p><h2>Kit&#39;s Friendship Fun</h2><p>Crafts, recipes, and games are designed to give a sense of the 1930s, or the period setting for books in the American Girls collection which feature the character named Kit. Original.</p><p>Grade 3-5-Based on "Kit" of the "American Girl" series, this book is brimming with vitality and wholesomeness. The book opens with four pages about the child's life and the challenges faced by her family during the Depression. The following five sections contain recipes, crafts, and games that would have been familiar to girls of the 1930s. The 18 tempting dishes, each accompanied by a color photo, include waffles, chili, macaroni and cheese, glazed carrots, roast-beef hash, banana cake, and more. The 17 crafts include sewing projects, a puzzle, a lamp shade, and a mosaic-tile trivet. Eight outdoor and indoor games provide lots of entertainment.

What drove Bethe, the head of Theoretical Physics at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project, to renounce the weaponry he had once worked so tirelessly to create? That is one of the questions answered by <i>Nuclear Forces,</i> a riveting biography of Bethe&#x2019;s early life and development as both a scientist and a man of principle. </p><p> </p><p> As Silvan Schweber follows Bethe from his childhood in Germany, to laboratories in Italy and England, and on to Cornell University, he shows how these differing environments were reflected in the kind of physics Bethe produced. Many of the young quantum physicists in the 1930s, including Bethe, had Jewish roots, and Schweber considers how Liberal Judaism in Germany helps explain their remarkable contributions. A portrait emerges of a man whose strategy for staying on top of a deeply hierarchical field was to tackle only those problems he knew he could solve. </p><p> </p><p> Bethe&#x2019;s emotional maturation was shaped by his father and by two women of Jewish background: his overly possessive mother and his wife, who would later serve as an ethical touchstone during the turbulent years he spent designing nuclear bombs. Situating Bethe in the context of the various communities where he worked, Schweber provides a full picture of prewar developments in physics that changed the modern world, and of a scientist shaped by the unprecedented moral dilemmas those developments in turn created.</p></p><p>Silvan S.

True to his Halloween birthdate, Robin's choice of topics have frequently leaned toward the supernatural and macabre. <p>Robin was raised in Concord, Massachusetts and attended Middlesex School and Belmont Hill School. After graduating from Belmont Hill, he joined the armed forces and flew a tour of combat missions over Germany during the closing days of World War II. He graduated from Harvard College in 1949 and went to New York to produce television shows. In 1952 he returned to Boston to work for the Sheraton Hotel Company co-founded by his father, Robert Lowell Moore senior. But, what Robin really wanted to do was write. </p><p>His first novel, Pitchman was about the burgeoning TV business. He continued to work for Sheraton and as a result of trying to establish Sheraton hotels in the Caribbean in the late 50s he ran across Fidel Castro which led to his chronicling the Cuban communist dictator's guerrilla campaign in a non-fiction book The Devil To Pay. A third novel about Robin's family business, Hotel Tomayne, brought about the end of his career in hotel management and was the start of his full-time writing career. </p><p>In 1963 his Harvard classmate, Robert Kennedy, President John F. Kennedy's brother, made it possible for Robin to join the US Army Special Forces as a civilian. Robin went through almost a year of training and then went to Vietnam with the Special Forces and wrote his definitive novel of the Vietnam War, The Green Berets which was published in May of 1965. </p><p>The French Connection followed this first success when Robin joined the New York police department in one of their most spectacular drug busts. Robin continued to write and his next big hit was The Happy Hooker with Xaviera Hollander, the story of the most controversial madam in New York City. </p><p>Robin then went on to write many more novels about international intrigue and adventure. He often traveled internationally to gather background material for his books. </p><p>Robin returned to Southeast Asia to write The Country Team about American diplomacy and Green Beret operations in Asia. The Khaki Mafia was next, chronicling the adventures of a beautiful, blond Australian girl's adventures as an entertainer and talent booker to US Army posts throughout Vietnam. </p><p>A stint as a treasure hunter in the Caribbean led to The Treasure Hunter. In the 70s Robin spent a year in Iran and the middle east researching his next novel, Dubai, an epic of gold smuggling, oil exploration, and political subversion in the Arab world. Two novels of gambling followed. The first was the story of a great con game, The Big Paddle and the other was the heartbreaking tale of a compulsive gambler, Compulsion. Robin returned to his hotel background in The Fifth Estate. </p><p>One of his more recent novels, The White Tribe, was the result of three years spent in Africa observing American and European mercenaries fighting communist terrorism. After Africa Robin traveled to Russia where he did extensive research leading to The Moscow Connection, the story of the sale of Russian nuclear weapons to rouge nations. His latest book, The Sparrowhook Curse, a paranormal tale of love and family revenge, was the result of many years summering at his parents island home on Cuttyhunk Island. </p><p>Robin continues to write and is currently working with Raymond Flynn, former US Ambassador to the Vatican and former Mayor of Boston, on a novel about Vatican intrigue, The Accidental Pope.</p></p><h2>Essence and Alchemy: A Book of Perfume</h2><p>As long as there has been passion, there has been perfume.

But the past is<br>never far behind. He's soon enmeshed in plans to<br>trap a notorious drug trafficker, and it seems that his<br>ex-wife, Sarina Carrington&#x2014;whom he so cruelly left<br>after one day of marriage&#x2014;may be more involved<br>than she's letting on. Not only that, but Sarina has<br>a six-year-old dark-eyed daughter whose father is<br>mysteriously absent&#x2014;or is he?</p><p>The prolific author of more than one hundred books, Diana Palmer got her start as a newspaper reporter. A New York Times bestselling author and voted one of the top ten romance writers in America, she has a gift for telling the most sensual tales with charm and humor. Diana lives with her family in Cornelia, Georgia.<p>It was an unusually cold morning for October in Houston, Texas, and Colby Lane's left arm ached. There wasn't a lot left of it, thanks to a stint as a covert specialist in Africa. He'd been too drunk to take proper precautions and it had been shot off, then amputated from just below his elbow. The state-of-theart prosthesis he wore was classified technology, very advanced, and the hand at the end of it looked real enough to fool most people. He even had sensation in it, thanks to implanted computer chips. He was, he mused, a walking, talking lab rat with stealth capability. He grinned to himself at the mental picture that thought produced.</p> <p>But the smile faded rapidly. He was in a foul mood. It was only his second full day on the job as new assistant chief of security for the Ritter Oil Corporation's Houston branch. He'd taken the job as a favor to his old friend, Phillip Hunter, who was training him to be his replacement. The Hunters were considering a move back to Tucson, Arizona.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Colby was trying to get used to new surroundings and at least two department heads who thought they knew how to do his job better than he did. He'd formerly worked for the international Hutton Corporation as another friend's assistant chief of security. Then the Hutton Corporation gave notice that it was moving overseas. He didn't want to go with it. Colby knew Hunter from his childhood on the reservation. Like him, Colby had Apache blood. But Colby also had an innate dislike of tight schedules, corporate politics and wearing a suit. His background in covert operations as a mercenary soldier, not to mention a brief stint in top-secret intelligence work for the government, made this routine job an uncomfortable fit. Office politics was a far cry from going after the enemy with weapons. The amputation of his arm had cost him the work he'd done all his life. He was bitter about that; in fact, he was bitter about a lot of things. Life had failed him. One old friend had voiced the opinion that Colby's growing array of wounds stemmed from a death wish. He hadn't admitted it aloud, but the accusation hit a nerve. He was tired of aching wounds, broken dreams, shattered illusions. He was tired of life itself.</p> <p>Here in Houston, he was trying to settle down for the first time in his life, with two failed marriages behind him and a past history of alcoholism. He'd overcome the drinking problem years ago. He was sober as a judge these days. But he no longer had the physical means to continue in demanding special operations work overseas. He resented forced retirement from his vocation of choice. His aching arm reminded him of all that he'd had to give up.</p> <p>He'd tried hard to put his past to the back of his mind. He had enough to worry about, getting used to this new job. His background, however, predisposed him for security work. He was an expert in martial arts and small arms, not to mention counterterrorism. He was a past master in interrogation techniques and he'd almost learned diplomacy. He had credentials that had even impressed Hunter&#x2014; not to mention Eugene Ritter, the head of Ritter Oil Corporation. Now he had to find a way to exercise diplomacy with words when he was used to doing it with firearms. It wasn't easy.</p> <p>He walked in the front door of the sprawling modern building in an industrial complex outside Houston, absently displaying his ID on a card clipped to his lapel as he passed the security guard at the desk. Ironic, he thought, that he was chief of security and still had to flash his own badge to get into the building he protected. The guard seemed to see the same irony, because he couldn't resist a grin. Colby returned it.</p> <p>He was an impressive figure in his navy-blue business suit. He was tall, handsome, lean, and physically formidable, with thick, shining black hair that held a slight wave. He had deep-set black eyes and an olive complexion, and he wore his hair conventionally cut. He never discussed his Apache ancestry. It wasn't immediately apparent, anyway, because there was a comfortable amount of white blood in his lineage. He was wearing his newest prosthesis, linked not only to muscle remnants in his left arm, but to his brain as well. It looked quite real, even up close, and he could do almost anything with it&#x2014;except lift. He could even "feel" hot and cold. The sensors were incredible.</p> <p>As he turned the corner toward the executive offices, he noticed two children playing in the corridor. Both were dark-haired and dark-eyed. Both were girls. He'd almost forgotten that it was bring-yourdaughter-to-work day for Ritter's employees. Just what he needed, a floor full of hyperactive children to contend with at the beginning of a new job. It wasn't that he didn't like children. But he was bitter because he had none of his own. He'd wanted them badly.</p> <p>His ex-wife, Maureen, had taunted him with his sterility before she left him. It was just as well, she'd said, because she didn't want mixed race children. She hadn't realized that he was part Apache when they'd married, or he might have been saved a lot of heartache. </p> <p>She'd been an obsession with him, in those days. When she walked out after only two years of marriage, he thought he'd die. When she'd divorced him three years later, he was devastated and turned to the bottle. It had taken him months to dry out and get his life back, with some help from friends and a psychologist. He'd conquered his demons. But children still reminded him of the pain.</p> <p>One of the children ran laughing down the hall. The other, who looked about six years old, stopped and stared at Colby from a pretty, intelligent face dominated by big brown eyes. She had long brown hair that reached her waist in back. She was lovely; Hispanic in appearance. Or perhaps she had Native American ancestry. He knew that Hunter had a little girl who was on the premises today. Perhaps this was her.</p> <p>The little girl came right up to him and reached up to touch the sleeve where the prosthesis protruded. "I'm sorry your arm got hurt. You shouldn't have been drinking. You weren't quick enough, so you couldn't get out of the way in time. But this hand looks very real, doesn't it?" She touched the hand, which he jerked back at once. "Does it still hurt you?" she asked matter-of-factly, staring up at him with dark eyes that seemed oddly familiar.</p> <p>His eyes exploded with rage. What had possessed Hunter to tell his daughter so much intimate information about him? How dare a child criticize Colby for not being quick enough to save his arm! In fact, how dare she make such a personal comment to a total stranger? He was touchy enough about missing part of his arm in the first place, without having attention drawn to it. Even close friends, whose interest he didn't mind, knew better than to say such things to him. It made him furious that a child should be so forward.</p> <p>"What business is it of yours?" he demanded in a soft tone that nevertheless cut like a whip. Added to the fierce scowl on his unsmiling face, it made him look very intimidating. "I don't answer to kids for my actions. And it's my arm!"</p> <p>"I!I'm sorry," the child stammered, shocked.</p> <p>"Who told you about it?" he demanded. "Answer me!"</p> <p>She shook her head nervously and ground her teeth together, tears threatening.</p> <p>He cursed harshly under his breath. "Get back to whoever you're with today, and stay out of the corridors!"&#x2014;he snapped at her. "This is a business, not a nursery school!"</p> <p>She backed away from him with wide, hurt eyes. She turned suddenly and ran back the way she'd come, her voice breaking on a sob.</p> <p>He ground his teeth together. He hadn't meant to attack the child like that. It had shocked and offended him that a child would be so personal, and so critical, with him. He didn't like remarks about his handicap. But he shouldn't have been so aggressive toward her. She'd been really upset.</p> <p>He started after her down the hall. Hunter came out of a side door, his eyebrows arching at the look on Colby's face.</p> <p>"What's eating you?" he asked.</p> <p>Colby grimaced as he faced his friend, the same height and build as himself, but a few years older. Hunter had a few gray hairs these days.</p> <p>"Is your daughter here today?" he asked Hunter.</p> <p>"Yes. Why?"</p> <p>He felt worse than ever. "I upset her. She made a remark about my arm and it hit me the wrong way." He glared at Hunter. "Why did you tell her how I lost it?"</p> <p>Hunter's eyes narrowed. "I've never told Nikki about your arm," he said curiously, puzzled.</p> She had long, dark hair and dark eyes. She looked Hispanic, I thought."<p></p> <p>"Oh, that might be Marie Gomez's little girl. Was she wearing an embroidered dress?"</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>Hunter hesitated.</p> <p>Colby grimaced. This was not a good way to start a new job. "I didn't mean to make her cry," he bit off, averting his eyes. "I'm not used to kids. What she said hit me the wrong way. But how would a stranger's child know such personal things about me?" he wondered aloud. He glared at Hunter. "I didn't sign on as a babysitter."</p> <p>"It's only for today," Hunter said. "The kids will all be gone tomorrow." </p> <p>Colby ground his teeth together. "I'd better find the little girl and apologize. She went down that way," he added, and moved reluctantly along the corridor.</p> <p>Hunter stood still. He was remembering something a friend and coworker here, Sarina Carrington, had said once about Colby Lane. She and her daughter and the Hunters were good friends from Tucson. She'd transferred here recently from Arizona. She was working with Hunter on a project he hadn't yet told Colby about&#x2014;in fact, he couldn't tell him about it. But Colby was about to get a very unpleasant shock. There was a connection that Colby didn't know about yet, and the child might figure in it. He wondered if he should stop the other man. He wasn't sure how he could, now.</p> <p>Colby noticed an open office door and he heard a child sobbing. He'd have to find a way to apologize for making her cry. He was no good with kids, and he hated women. Probably the child's mother would be out for his blood. He was new here and already he was making enemies. Old man Ritter wouldn't like that. He'd better try to smooth things over. But this was going to be difficult.And he had questions about the child's source of information about him, as well.</p> <p>He walked into the office in time to see the little girl folded close to a slender woman's breasts, cradled and kissed. Sleek pale blond hair was tamed in a neat French twist at the woman's nape. Her voice was tender as she comforted the child, rocking her in her arms. There was something familiar about that voice!</p></p><h2>The Gift Giving: Favourite Stories (Virago Modern Classics) [Paperback] [Nov 03, 2016] Joan Aiken</h2><p>Gift Giving Favourite Stories</p><p>Joan Aiken (Author) Joan Aiken (1924-2004) was born in Rye, Sussex.

Among birds alone, over 3,100 species are either resident or migrant. Birds are some of South America's treasures and also one of its most endangered resources. Hence the need for a descriptive record of South American birds that will serve both professional and amateur bird students and encourage conservation of these magnificent species. </p><p>Although South American birds elicit much popular and scientific interest, they have never been completely or satisfactorily described and cataloged in a single, published source. The Birds of South America, projected to be a four-volume work, thus fills a critical void. Starting from a museum approach, the authors have examined specimens of each subspecies, comparing them visually and trying to discern the patterns in their plumage variation, both intra- and inter-specifically. They take a new look at bird systematics, reassessing relationships in light of new information. Perhaps most important, they combine this review and analysis with extensive field observations to give an accurate, incisive portrait of the birds in nature.</p> <p>At a time when rapid development is devastating millions of acres of tropical habitat in South America, this record of an endangered resource becomes crucial. If the birds and other plants and animals of South America are to be saved, they must first be known and appreciated. The Birds of South America is a major step in that direction. </p><p> Volume II includes the Ovenbirds and Woodcreepers, Antbirds, Gnatcatchers, and Tapaculos; Tyrant Flycatchers; and Manakins and Cotingas.</p> <p>The remaining volumes of The Birds of South America will be:</p> <ul> <li>Volume III: The Nonpasserines (Landbirds)</li> <li>Volume IV: The Nonpasserines (Waterbirds)</li> </ul> <p> No release date has been set for the remaining volumes.</p></p><p>&#39;Everyone who works with South American birds, whether amateur birder of professional ornithologist, will want a copy... I hope that everyone will appreciate the tremendous amount of work that went into its completion. The authors are to be congratulated. I strongly recommend The Birds Of South America.&#39;ROBERT S.

She has no memory of her parents or her childhood. In a decade of service with the State Police, Sam has exhausted the resources of the force searching for clues to her identity. But all mention of her family seems to have been deliberately wiped off the record. Everything changes the night Sam&#x2019;s missing partner resurfaces as a vampire . . . and forces her to kill him in self-defense. Now Sam is charged with murder. Suspended from the force, and with no one left to trust, Sam accepts some unexpected help from Gabriel Stern, a shapeshifter who conceals startling secrets.<br> &nbsp;<br> While investigating the circumstances surrounding her partner&#x2019;s strange behavior, Sam discovers that Garbriel&#x2019;s been involved with a dangerous organization that&#x2019;s planning a war on the human race. More immediate, someone is guarding the truth about Sam&#x2019;s past&#x2014;someone who&#x2019;d rather see her dead than risk her knowing too much. To stay alive, Sam must unravel the threads of her past&#x2014;and find out not only <i>who</i> she is but <i>what</i> she is.</p><p><b>Keri Arthur</b>, author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Riley Jenson Guardian series, has written more than two dozen books. She&#x2019;s received several nominations in the Best Contemporary Paranormal category of the <i>Romantic Times</i> Reviewers&#x2019; Choice Awards and recently won <i>RT</i>&#x2019;s Career Achievement Award for urban fantasy. She lives with her daughter in Melbourne, Australia.<p>One</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was the type of night only the dead could enjoy&#x2014;as dark as hell, and as warm as the Antarctic. Add to that the bonus of rain bucketing down, and it was no wonder the streets were deserted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well, almost deserted, Sam amended, glancing at the alleyway across the street. An old man in a threadbare coat rummaged through the garbage bins that were lined up behind the Chinese restaurant, filling a plastic bag with God knows what. And not five minutes ago, two prostitutes had come knocking on her car&#x2019;s window, their faces almost blue with cold as they&#x2019;d tried to convince her to take them for a ride. Their expressions, when she&#x2019;d flashed her badge, were almost relieved. But then, a warm cell block was certainly more enticing than trying to ply their trade on a night like this. Had she not been waiting for her partner to turn up, she might have taken them downtown and charged them with soliciting, just to get them off the street and warm again. Prostitution might be legal these days, but it was restricted to certain areas, and this particular street wasn&#x2019;t one of them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But she&#x2019;d had no choice except to let them go with a warning. To say they weren&#x2019;t happy with this stroke of fortune was an understatement. Obviously, they&#x2019;d been looking forward to being locked up in a warm cell. And right now, she knew exactly how they felt. Even a cup of the shocking coffee they served at the station house would be heaven right now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She glanced down at the onboard computer and noted it was already after three. If her goddamn partner didn&#x2019;t turn up soon, she was heading home. Why the hell he&#x2019;d insisted on meeting in this ratty section of the city in the first place was beyond her. It wasn&#x2019;t even close to their patrol zone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sighing, she crossed her arms and glanced out the driver&#x2019;s-side window again. A plastic bag tumbled down the road, ghostlike in the darkness. Unease pricked across her skin, though she wasn&#x2019;t sure why. Maybe it was just nerves. After all, it wasn&#x2019;t every night she got an urgent call from a man who&#x2019;d been missing for weeks. And it certainly wasn&#x2019;t every night that she went against department policy and agreed to a secret meeting.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She glanced back to the alley. The old man had disappeared. While she knew he&#x2019;d probably just moved beyond her line of sight, that vague sense of unease increased. She stared through the rain-washed darkness, watching for some form of movement that would indicate the old man was still there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And instinct was insisting something was very wrong in that alley.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She rubbed a hand across her eyes and silently cursed her partner&#x2019;s tardiness. She didn&#x2019;t need this, not after a fifteen-hour shift&#x2014;and especially not in a patrol zone that wasn&#x2019;t hers. Just thinking about the extra paperwork made her head ache.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Still&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She leaned forward and pressed the locater switch. The onboard computer hummed to life, producing a map of the immediate vicinity. The only way out of the alley, besides the entrance she could see, was via a fire escape on the building that housed the Chinese restaurant. She stabbed a finger at the screen, and the computer immediately listed other occupants. The top two floors were empty, but the second floor was rented to an R.&nbsp;C. Clarke. A quick background check revealed nothing more than the fact that he was an accountant with a clean record. For several seconds, she blindly watched the rain race down the glass. It was very wet out there. But the sooner she got out and investigated, the sooner she could get back to the relative warmth of this icebox they had the cheek to call a squad car.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With a slight grimace, she opened the glove compartment and retrieved her wristcom. In reality, it wasn&#x2019;t just a communications unit, but more a two-inch-wide minicomputer capable of doing just about everything but make coffee. She wasn&#x2019;t supposed to be using it after hours, but there was no way she was going into that alley without it. Not when unease sat like a lead weight in her belly. If things went wrong, she wanted an electronic record of everything that happened.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After fastening the unit onto her wrist, she flicked the record button, checked that it was working, then collected her gun and climbed out of the car. As the door automatically locked behind her, she zipped up her jacket and eyed the dark alley. It was quite possible that this was some sort of setup. In the last few weeks, five detectives had disappeared, one of them Jack, her partner. And while he&#x2019;d finally contacted her earlier this evening, it was extremely odd that he&#x2019;d called neither headquarters nor Suzy, his wife. She knew, because she&#x2019;d checked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It worried her.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And it was what held her still, even as the drenching rain sluiced off her coat and soaked through her boots. Jack loved Suzy more than life itself, and there was no way he&#x2019;d contact Sam before he contacted his wife.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Though the fact that he had would only add fuel to Suzy&#x2019;s almost obsessive jealousy. Suzy had always resented Jack&#x2019;s closeness to his partner, and while Sam respected Jack&#x2019;s relationship with his wife, she&#x2019;d never warmed to the woman.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The wind lifted her hair and wrapped icy fingers around her neck. She shivered, but it had nothing to do with the cold. Suddenly, the night felt very wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Which was crazy. It was probably just the cold, the rain, and her severe need for sleep. If Jack hadn&#x2019;t made an appearance by the time she checked the alley, she was going home. She didn&#x2019;t need to be involved in another of his stupid games, in the dead of night, after a very long shift. If he wanted to talk to her, he could do so during the day. He knew where she lived&#x2014;and knew he was welcome there anytime. She clipped the gun to her belt. Its familiar weight offered a sense of comfort from the uneasiness that still stirred through her as she walked across the road.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The rain eased a little as she entered the alley, but the wind danced through the darkness with a forlorn moan that made the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end. She hesitated, her gaze skating across the shadows. The old man&#x2019;s possessions were strewn across the ground near the garbage bins. They amounted to little more than a few old books, a couple of credit cards, and the scraps of food he&#x2019;d ferreted out of the bin.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She bent and picked up the cards. The names on them were all different&#x2014;Joseph Ramsey, Tom King, Jake George. Obviously, the old guy had not been above a little credit fraud. She dropped the cards, then stepped across the books and cautiously walked deeper into the alley. The darkness was blanket heavy, but her eyes slowly adjusted. Shapes loomed through the ink of night. On the right side of the alley, a dozen or so large boxes were stacked haphazardly against a graffiti-covered wall, and to her left was the fire escape that zigzagged up the restaurant wall.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She walked past the rusted metal ladder, then stopped. With the full force of the wind blocked by the buildings on either side, the smells that permeated the alley came into their own. Rotting rubbish, puddles of stale water, and the faintest hint of human excrement all combined into a stomach-churning stench. She shuddered and tried breathing through her mouth rather than her nose, but it didn&#x2019;t help much.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Twenty feet away the alley came to a dead end, blocked by a wall at least fifteen feet high. Unless the old guy had springs for legs, or wings hidden under his threadbare coat&#x2014;both of which were certainly possible in this day and age&#x2014;there was no way he could have gotten over it. She glanced across to the boxes. It didn&#x2019;t make any sense for him to be hiding there, either&#x2014;especially when he&#x2019;d have to have abandoned his belongings to do so. Most street people clung to their few possessions with a ferocity only death could shatter. Besides, the rain had turned the boxes into a sodden mass that would have collapsed with the slightest touch.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Which left only the fire escape.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She glanced up. Moisture dripped from above, splattering across her face. She wiped it away with her palm, then frowned and glanced down. Why did the rain suddenly feel warm?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In her heart, she knew the answer to that question even as it crossed her mind. Grimly, she pressed a small switch on her wristcom. Light flared from the unit&#x2014;a pale yellow that glowed uneasily against the darkness. She raised her arm and shined the light on the metal walkway above her.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just as she&#x2019;d thought, it wasn&#x2019;t rain dripping down from the fire escape, but blood. But there wasn&#x2019;t a body&#x2014;or, at least, not one that she could see from where she stood.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For a moment, she considered contacting headquarters about a possible homicide. But Jack had asked her to come here alone, had specifically asked her not to contact them. She didn&#x2019;t understand why and, in the end, she didn&#x2019;t really care. He&#x2019;d been her partner for close to five years, and she trusted him more than she trusted the boneheads and politicians back at headquarters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wiping her palm down her thigh, she reached back for her gun. Then slowly, cautiously, she began to climb.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Three flights up she found the old man. He&#x2019;d been thrown against the far edge of the landing, his body a broken and bloody mass that barely resembled anything human. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Death was never easy. In her ten years on the force, she&#x2019;d come across many of its faces, yet it still had the power to shock her.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Especially when it was as gruesome as this.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The old man&#x2019;s eyes were wide with fear, his mouth locked in a scream that would never be heard. His flesh had been stripped from his face, leaving a bloody mass of raw veins and muscle. No vampire had done this. In fact, none of the nonhuman species currently on record were capable of an act like this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She took another deep breath, then knelt by the old man&#x2019;s side and felt his neck. No pulse, as expected, but his skin was still very warm. The murderer had to be close.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Really close.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Metal creaked above her. Her pulse rate zooming, she grabbed her gun and twisted around, sights aimed at the landing above her. Nothing moved. No one came down the stairs. The wind moaned loudly, but nothing else could be heard beyond the harsh echo of her breathing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cautiously, she rose and walked back to the ladder. One more flight and she&#x2019;d reach the rooftop. Whoever, or whatever, had done that to the old man might still be up there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She had to call for backup. There was no other choice, not in a situation like this. Pressing the communication switch, she waited for a response and quickly asked for help. The closest unit was seven minutes away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her gaze went back to the landing above her and she bit her lip. Was there anyone up there? Was Jack up there? Or was this all some sort of weird setup? No, she thought. He wouldn&#x2019;t do that to her. And it had been him on the comlink. Her security system had identified his voice. So the fact that the old man had been murdered at the same time she was supposed to have met her partner had to be coincidence.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But where was Jack?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She glanced down at her wristcom. It was twenty-nine minutes past three. It wasn&#x2019;t unusual for him to be late. In the five years she&#x2019;d known him, the only thing he&#x2019;d managed to be on time for was his wedding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe he was here. Maybe he was a victim of the creature who&#x2019;d destroyed the old man.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Panic surged at the thought. God, she couldn&#x2019;t risk the wait for backup, not when Jack&#x2019;s life might be at stake. She had to go on. She had to try and find him. If the department decided to discipline her for leaving a crime scene, then so be it. As long as she found her partner safe and sound, she didn&#x2019;t really give a damn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As she reached the rooftop, the full force of the wind hit her, thrusting her back a step before she regained her balance. Shivering, she dragged her coat zipper all the way up her neck, but it didn&#x2019;t stop the rain from getting past the collar and trickling down her back.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;This is great, just great,&#x201d; she muttered, wiping the water from her eyes&#x2014;a totally useless gesture, given the conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Visibility was practically zero. If there was someone up here with her, all he had to do was remain still and she&#x2019;d never even see him. With a final, regretful glance at the alley below her, she moved forward across the rooftop. After a dozen steps, a dark, boxlike shape loomed out of the grayness. Stairs to the rooms below, presumably.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She found a door and tested it cautiously. The handle turned. With her back to the wall, gun raised, she pushed the door open and listened for any sign of movement. Still nothing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yet instinct told her the murderer had to be inside. There was nowhere else he could be, nowhere else he really could have come from. Unless, of course, he could fly. But if he could fly, why would he have used the fire escape? Why wouldn&#x2019;t he have just dragged the old man&#x2019;s body down to the end of the alley rather than up the stairs, then flown away?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No, he was here, down those stairs, somewhere.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She switched the com-unit&#x2019;s light back on, then crossed her wrists, holding the gun and light to one side of her body as she edged forward.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The light gleamed off the metal stairs and puddled against the deeper darkness of the room. Three steps down, she halted again, listening. The silence was so intense it felt as if she could reach out and touch it. With unease growing, she frowned and edged down the remaining steps.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the small circle of light she could see several stacks of chairs lined up against the wall. Beyond that were the vague shapes of upturned tables. Obviously, someone was using the empty floor as a storage facility. She moved across to the first stack of chairs and stopped again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Something hit her&#x2014;an invisible force that came out of the darkness to slam her back against the wall. Her breath left in a whoosh of air, and for several heartbeats, she saw stars. Then her senses seemed to explode outward. Just for an instant, the darkness became something that was real, something that had flavor and taste and body. And then she realized that it <i>did</i> have bodies, and that she was sensing its inhabitants through every pore and fiber of her being. As if, in that one moment, she inhabited the skins of the beings out there in the shadows, learning their secrets, feeling their thoughts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of those who hid in the shadows was a vampire.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The other wasn&#x2019;t human, wasn&#x2019;t vampire, and wasn...</p></p><h2>Might and Magic VII: For Blood and Honor: Prima&#39;s Official Strategy Guide</h2><p>Detailed guides for every region<br> Expert advice on party creation and development<br> Complete skill and spell lists<br> In-depth walkthroughs for every quest<br> Essential creature attribute tables</p><p><i>Might &amp; Magic VII</i> is the latest title in one of the best and most popular role-playing series available on the PC.

Bas had tried to ignore it, no, actually he hadn&#x2019;t. He&#x2019;d seen her about two minutes after she&#x2019;d taken her seat at the table just ten feet away from his. She&#x2019;d smiled and conversed with the others around her, all the while casing the room for something, until landing on him. Females did not normally affect him this way, they didn&#x2019;t look at him and cause all the blood in his body to run hotter and faster throughout his veins. They didn&#x2019;t call to him throughout the night in a room full of about six hundred people and they definitely did not wander around hotel hallways attempting to break into private suites&#x2014;the private suites of Roman Reynolds, Leader of the Stateside Assembly.</p> <p>She mumbled something against his hand, her lips brushing over his skin with the effort. His teeth gritted so hard he thought his jaw might break, warmth flooding him so fast and so potently he felt like he might melt with the intensity. In seconds his defensive stance shifted to something more powerful, more lethal to anyone on its receiving end. He pressed his body closer, let the curves of hers fit perfectly against him. Her ass was cradled by his now-jutting hips, and felt so sweet he almost gasped. Moving his arm upward just a few inches had the curve of her breasts resting against his arms. But both those actions and reactions were basic&#x2014;male body parts plus female body parts equaled sexual desire, plain and simple, the circle of life so to speak.</p> <p>Then he inhaled and that circle broke, it bent and reshaped until Bas felt like it was a lasso instead, tightening slowly, keeping them together regardless. Her scent consumed him, filtering through his body like an infusion of pleasure, a drug so pure and so powerful he automatically wanted more. Leaning forward, his lips only inches from her earlobe he whispered, &#x201c;If you scream I&#x2019;ll break your neck.&#x201d;</p> <p>Slowly, he moved his hand away from her mouth, keeping her body pressed tightly against the wall, firmly covered by his own.</p> <p>&#x201c;You really need to work on your greeting,&#x201d; came her cool response, delivered in a sultry voice that wasn&#x2019;t so deep as to be off-putting and wasn&#x2019;t too high as to work his nerves. It was, he thought, inhaling another dangerous whiff of her scent, alluring.</p> <p>&#x201c;Do I now?&#x201d; Bas asked with a slight chuckle to his tone. &#x201c;And what do you need to work on? Your surveillance skills maybe? You picked the wrong room and the wrong person to follow tonight.&#x201d;</p> <p>Her next move was totally surprising, especially to Sebastian Perry, multimillionaire resort owner and playboy extraordinaire. She wiggled her ass against his now-throbbing erection, turned, and tilted her head so that when she spoke her next words he could actually see her lips move and feel her warm breath fan over his face.</p> <p>&#x201c;Maybe I need to work on you,&#x201d; she whispered about two seconds before her elbow smashed into the right side of his ribs.</p> <p>Another man, a human, may have buckled at the assault but Bas, a Faction Leader in the Stateside Assembly, barely blinked. He did, however, take about a five-inch step back, which gave her enough time to spin around and face him, but not get away.</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, that can definitely be arranged,&#x201d; he replied, moving into her once more.</p> <p>While he&#x2019;d loved the enticing cushion of her ass against his dick, he was now enjoying the heavy swells of her breasts pressed against his chest, threatening to overflow from the tight bodice of her dress. Her hair was short, shorter than he usually preferred on his females but cut in a chic style that he now realized echoed her snappy and courageous personality. She had a small face, plump lips, wide eyes, and high cheekbones. Everything about her seemed to scream blatant desire, and yet, there was something else.</p> <p>&#x201c;This may be some form of harassment,&#x201d; she told him, her hands pushing futilely against his chest.</p> <p>Bas, the smooth, cocky sonofabitch he was sometimes known as, only smiled. &#x201c;No, this would be harassment,&#x201d; he told her a second before cupping her ass cheeks in his palms and leaning forward to lick the seam of her lips.</p> <p>He pressed her into him so hard and so fast his dick just about burst through the zipper of his tuxedo pants. Against his spine his cat pressed for more, teeth bared with the idea of conquest. He should have moved away at the quick inhale of her breath, the renewed effort to break free, but that only spurred Bas on, flicking on a switch inside him that had almost been permanently off.</p> <p>Moving slightly to the right, his tongue ran a line along her jaw, down the length of her neck to her collarbone, which was left open for his perusal by the extremely low cut of her come-fuck-me red dress. Her breath had hitched, her heart pounding against her chest, her fingers clenching in the lapels of his jacket just as his teeth nipped along her soft skin.</p> <p>Then she moved and Bas knew what would come next. His hand followed her motion, slipping down the back of her thigh to grab her calf just as her knee planned to slam into his groin. When she pushed at him he let her, but still held on to her leg, leaving her to flail against falling flat on the floor. After a split second of her looking helpless and extremely pissed off, he circled her waist with his free arm, holding her once more against him.</p> <p>&#x201c;We just keep ending up in this position,&#x201d; he said as this time she stood with only one foot on the ground, her other leg&#x2014;the one that had been meant to assault him&#x2014;hiked up against his side.</p> <p>&#x201c;Is this how you like it? Standing up against the wall, your legs wrapped around me while I pump you until you come?&#x201d; She opened her mouth to speak, clapped those medium-thick lips shut, and glared up at him instead.</p> <p>&#x201c;Let me go,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Or I&#x2019;ll scream so loud every security officer in this building will come running.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You mean the security officers that allowed you to come onto this private floor and skulk around this private suite?&#x201d; Bas shook his head. &#x201c;Apparently, they&#x2019;re on a smoke break.&#x201d; He let her leg fall to the ground and moved so that now his fingers traced the line of her neck. &#x201c;Now, I&#x2019;ll ask you one more time what you were doing here and you can either answer me&#x201d;&#x2014;he lowered his voice purposely, letting his finger glide over the spot on her collarbone he&#x2019;d just licked seconds before&#x2014;&#x201c;or you can fuck me. I&#x2019;ll let you make the choice.&#x201d;</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Curiosity killed the cat.</p> <p>That old saying ran back and forth through Priya&#x2019;s head, bringing forth the memory of sneaking into the boxes underneath her mother&#x2019;s bed in search of whatever her mother reached for at night that left her so out of it, she couldn&#x2019;t even get up in the morning to get her kids ready for school.</p> <p>Now, true to its meaning, it seemed her curious nature had gotten her into another mess she wished she&#x2019;d never laid eyes on. Only, this six-foot-plus, built like a quarterback, smooth as the buttery tone of his skin, and sexy as&nbsp;&#x2026; well, sexy as in had her nipples so hard they now hurt, man wasn&#x2019;t precisely the same as finding her mother&#x2019;s stash of crack cocaine.</p> <p>She&#x2019;d seen him before, earlier tonight at the reception for President Wilson Reed, in the ballroom. Up close and personal he was even more handsome than he had been from two tables away. His skin tone was light, hair wavy and dark, his face was clean-shaven with a strong nose and jawline. And his eyes, they weren&#x2019;t the smoky-gray color she&#x2019;d originally surmised. Stormy would be the better word as he glared at her with what she thought could pass as either barely masked contempt or intense sexual desire&#x2014;she wasn&#x2019;t really in the mood for either at the moment.</p> <p>&#x201c;Look, there&#x2019;s been some type of misunderstanding,&#x201d; she tried to tell him, the final word coming as a partial whisper after deciding to ignore his &#x201c;you can fuck me&#x201d; remark. That may have been a little cowardly, which was out of character for Priya, but she figured it was a smart move considering she was actually thinking of doing just that with him.</p> <p>He looked at her as if he could tell she was lying or ready to tell the lie before the words could even escape. She felt like clamping her lips shut and keeping them that way, until he did that thing he&#x2019;d done with his tongue again&#x2014;oh, she&#x2019;d definitely open her mouth the next time he did that.</p> <p>Right, because sexual arousal was exactly what she should be thinking about in lieu of the e-mails she&#x2019;d been receiving that threatened the lives of all the people she loved and cherished in this world. Thinking about taking this man up on his oh-so-enticing offer&#x2014;especially since the self-imposed celibacy she&#x2019;d endured for the last year was about to take its toll&#x2014;was definitely more important than following her blackmailer&#x2019;s orders and saving her family. In some crazy twisted world, she thought with an inward sigh. She knew she had no choice here and for the billionth time tonight wondered how she was going to do what needed to be done, when the people involved were reputedly more powerful than the president himself.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a reporter from the <i>Washington Post.</i> I wanted to get a comment from Mr. Reynolds about President Reed&#x2019;s campaign,&#x201d; she blurted out. &#x201c;There, satisfied now that you know why I&#x2019;m here?&#x201d;</p> <p>He looked like he was anything but, still he&#x2019;d released his hold on her, physically, that is. His eyes still bore into her as if he were performing some type of perverted X-ray of her body right in this hallway.</p> <p>&#x201c;You waited all night, the entire three and a half hours that Mr. Reynolds was downstairs in that ballroom to follow him to his room to ask for a statement?&#x201d;</p> <p>He lifted a brow in disbelief as he spoke. The slight rasp of his deep voice echoing around her as if forever planting itself in her memory, like she&#x2019;d really forget being felt up by this guy, which was definitely not going to happen.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my job,&#x201d; she told him with a shrug. &#x201c;And since I&#x2019;m assuming you&#x2019;re some type of bodyguard and not going to let me get that statement, I&#x2019;ll just be going.&#x201d;</p> <p>Priya was more than shocked that he hadn&#x2019;t reached out to grab her again, to try and stop her from leaving. Instead, she&#x2019;d walked about three very uncomfortable steps because she knew he was staring at her ass as she did, before his voice stopped her.</p> <p>&#x201c;Have a drink with me?&#x201d;</p> <p>She turned. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p> <p>He closed the space between them, taking her by her elbow, much more gently than he had touched her before, yet still sending electrifying spikes up her arm.</p> <p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll go down to the bar since having you in my room might lead us to other things besides a nice cordial drink.&#x201d; He continued as if she&#x2019;d already accepted, walking them to the elevators at the far end of the hall that had brought her up here about fifteen minutes before.</p> <p>Once they were inside the elevator and she felt like she needed to stop this impending train wreck, Priya turned to him and announced, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not the reporter who sleeps with someone for a story.&#x201d;</p> <p>He looked at her then, an amused grin on his face&#x2014;amused and way too cocky for her, but still sexy as hell.</p> <p>&#x201c;Good, because I don&#x2019;t sleep with reporters. I do, however, take beautiful women to bed and give them a night they&#x2019;ll never forget. Tonight, however, I&#x2019;ll settle for a glass of wine.&#x201d;</p> <p>Rebuffed and not sure whether or not she disliked it or felt relief, Priya kept her mouth shut. It wasn&#x2019;t an easy task since she&#x2019;d always been inclined to ask questions, always searching for answers. Sometimes, however, the answers she found were more than she&#x2019;d bargained for. That was part of the reason she was here tonight, on this foolhardy mission to uncover something she wasn&#x2019;t sure she believed herself.</p> <p>Still, it was apparent that this man knew Reynolds personally. In the last two weeks Priya had interviewed everyone from a receptionist in Reynolds&#x2019;s office to the manager of the detail shop where his SUV was dropped off every Friday afternoon. Her file on the man was almost an inch thick with one glowing remark after another. He appeared so squeaky clean she&#x2019;d felt sick each time she flipped through her notes. So, if having a glass of wine with this new person she&#x2019;d seen with Reynolds could help get this task completed sooner, rather than later, she&#x2019;d do it, and whatever else she had to, if it would save her family&#x2019;s life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by A.C.

Though most of the American effort was devoted to bomber aircraft, a general specification was issued for a high altitude interceptor. These specifications called for an aircraft with a speed of 300 mph at 20,000 feet and an endurance of one hour at full throttle. When Lockheed won the XP-38 contract, the men assigned to the XP-38 lavished considerable attention to the big fighter. The ship was hand-built, and the excellent workmanship showed when the plane was rolled out for the first time. Every inch of it was polished to a high gloss.</p><p></p><h2>The Moon Princess / Kaguyahime (Kodansha&#39;s Children&#39;s Classics) (English and Japanese Edition)</h2><p>An old bamboo cutter finds a tiny child in the hollow of a bamboo stalk.

It also suffered financial difficulties, and arguments with track organizers.</p><p>This book explains what NART was, how it was formed, and what it achieved over three decades of competition. It wasn't just sports cars that were entered into races, NART entered Formula One cars and Formula Junior cars as well.</p><p>Never as financially stable as his rival team owners, Chinetti did deals with Ferrari to purchase the latest specification sports cars at the end of a season, in order to attract the best drivers to drive for NART. It was also an opportunity to lease the cars on a race-by-race basis, an arrangement that appealed to some of Chinetti's clientele.</p><p>Whilst success on the track was significant, problems were never far away. Working on the cars with a limited number of staff, and not receiving spares from Ferrari on time, NART always appeared to be in a state of crisis.</p><p>No matter ... despite the difficulties, the formula worked well for Luigi Chinetti, and the acronym N.A.R.T. has rightly become legendary.</p></p><p><p>Born in Hertfordshire, Terry O'Neil has lived the majority of his life in the West Midlands.

Like any place, Shubuta (population 650) is inhabited by good people and bad, by virtue and vice. Both a literary memoir and a cultural history, this book chronicles Yates's return to the town in which she first knew goodness and came to recognize immorality. Blending folklore and personal impressions with the words of Shubuta people telling their own stories, Yates offers a rich narrative of the town from its Choctaw prehistory through the tremendous economic, political, racial, and social changes that led to its present. <br>The author's pilgrimage leads us to the Hanging Bridge, where some black Shubutans were lynched; to a bank that did not fail during the Great Depression; and to the office of the doctor who tends broken hearts as well as broken arms. Yates takes us to Shubuta's most beautiful gardens and ugliest vacant lots, to all the stores in town, to the new post office, and to the town hall. In the process, we learn how Shubuta evolved from a racially stratified town to one in which the descendants of slaves are now political leaders, librarians, business owners, and police officials. Yates also tells of her own moral journey from judgmental young activist to middle-aged scholar mellowed by experience, travel, and reading who sees her home with newfound compassion. Ultimately, she shows us Small Town southern America: a strong, frail, fascinating, and complex human community.</p></p><p><p><b>Graham Yates</b> is a professor emerita of American studies at the University of Minnesota and the author of several books, most recently <i>Mississippi Mind: A Personal Cultural History of an American State.</i></p></p><h2>Wicked Angels (Les Mauvais Anges)</h2><p>A classic French gay novel, banned for thirty years, now lovingly translated into English.</p><p></p><h2>Seven Plays of the Modern Theatre: Waiting for Godot, The Quare Fellow, A Taste of Honey, The Connection, The Balcony, Rhinoceros, The Birthday Party</h2><p>Seven Plays of the Modern Theatre: Waiting for Godot, The Quare Fellow, A Taste of Honey, The Connection, The Balcony, Rhinoceros, The Birthday Party [Paperback]</p><p></p><h2>SPV&#39;s Comprehensive Railroad Atlas of North America: Prairies West</h2><p>The SPV Railroad atlases provide a single source of reference to the North American rail network, past and present.

Follow her on Twitter&nbsp;@LisaGraff.<b>The Last Day of Fourth Grade</b><br><b>a year before what happened happened</b><br><br>There are a lot of things you should probably know to understand why a bunch of kids decided to climb up a treehouse and not come down. But to really understand it, you&#x2019;d have to go way back in time, and peek through the living room window of a girl named Winifred Malladi-Maraj, on her last day of fourth grade. Since time travel isn&#x2019;t possible, you&#x2019;ll just have to picture things. So picture this:<br><br>After walking home from school, Winnie stepped through the front door, with her backpack over her shoulder. Winnie&#x2019;s parents were sitting on the living room couch, with their hands in their laps. They were watching the front door, like they&#x2019;d been waiting for their daughter for a long time.<br><br>Winnie pulled off her backpack and dropped it in the doorway. Buttons, who is the world&#x2019;s greatest cat, wove his way between Winnie&#x2019;s legs, like he knew she was about to need snuggling. &#x201c;Mom?&#x201d; Winnie said, squinting her eyes at her parents on the couch. &#x201c;Dad?&#x201d; She could tell right away that something weird was going on.<br><br>It&#x2019;s probably important to know that Winnie&#x2019;s parents have never been exactly normal. Like, instead of playing board games after dinner, the way some families did, Winnie&#x2019;s dad&#x2014;a biologist&#x2014;might sit her down for a slide show about his latest research on the beneficial properties of bat guano, which only made Winnie wish she&#x2019;d never eaten dinner at all. Or Winnie&#x2019;s mom&#x2014;a mathematician&#x2014;might try to explain her current work on the Conway&#x2019;s thrackle conjecture, which only made Winnie wish she&#x2019;d never grown ears.<br><br>(Once, Winnie made the mistake of asking if she and her parents could play Boggle after dinner, and afterward she&#x2019;d had to sit through a two-hour presentation of all of her parents&#x2019; many awards and grants&#x2014;none of which, they informed Winnie, had been won playing Boggle&#x2014;and a four-hour argument about whether or not Winnie&#x2019;s dad had more awards than Winnie&#x2019;s mom because there were simply more prizes for biologists than there were for mathematicians.)<br><br>(Winnie never asked about Boggle again.)<br><br>But finding her parents waiting for her on the couch together seemed especially weird to Winnie. Because, normally, Winnie&#x2019;s parents weren&#x2019;t even home when she got out of school. Normally, Winnie started her homework all by herself and then heated water on the stove exactly at 5:55 p.m., so the pot would be boiling and ready to put pasta in as soon as they got home. (Winnie&#x2019;s parents were very precise about mealtimes.)<br><br>(They were very precise about a lot of stuff.)<br><br>Another weird thing Winnie noticed that afternoon was the way her parents were sitting. While she was standing in the doorway with Buttons weaving between her legs, she realized that she hadn&#x2019;t ever seen both of her parents on the same couch before. When they watched television or sat with guests, Winnie&#x2019;s mom usually squished herself against one couch arm, while her dad sat in the recliner on the far side of the room.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; Winnie asked. Even Buttons let out a confused&nbsp;<i>mew?</i><br><br>&#x201c;Come sit down,&#x201d; Winnie&#x2019;s mom replied, patting the couch cushion between herself and Winnie&#x2019;s dad.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Winnie&#x2019;s dad agreed. (That was another weird thing, Winnie noticed. Her parents&nbsp;<i>never</i>agreed.) &#x201c;Have a seat. We marked a spot for you.&#x201d;<br><br>And that was the weirdest thing of all. There was a tiny X of masking tape stuck to the center of the middle couch cushion. Her parents, Winnie realized as she stepped closer, had measured out a spot for her, so that she&#x2019;d be sitting exactly evenly between them&#x2014;not one millimeter closer to one than the other.<br><br>But Winnie, who was pretty used to her parents being weird, decided there was nothing to do but sit. Buttons sat, too, hopping right into her lap.<br><br>&#x201c;Winifred,&#x201d; her mom said. She cleared her throat. &#x201c;Your father and I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh no,&#x201d; Winnie&#x2019;s dad cut in, putting up a hand to stop Winnie&#x2019;s mom. &#x201c;We agreed I would tell her. You got to tell Winifred about the tooth fairy.&#x201d;<br><br>Winnie&#x2019;s mom frowned. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see how that&#x2019;s pertinent, Varun. This is an entirely different&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We discussed this,&#x201d; Winnie&#x2019;s dad argued. &#x201c;But once again, you&#x2019;re attempting to ruin&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>While Winnie&#x2019;s parents argued, Buttons purred a little louder in Winnie&#x2019;s lap, scrunching his head under her hand. Winnie scratched and scratched at Buttons&#x2019;s soft orange fur, while her parents argued and argued. Winnie watched her mom, so angry with her dad. She watched her dad, so furious with her mom. Her parents might have been acting weird, Winnie realized, but the fighting, that was completely normal.<br><br>And when she realized that, Winnie knew, deep in her gut, precisely why her parents had sat her down on that tiny X of masking tape.<br><br>&#x201c;You guys are getting a divorce, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; she asked them.<br><br>Her parents stopped fighting at once. They turned, both together, and they stared at her.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the thing you were going to tell me, right?&#x201d; Winnie said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Winnie&#x2019;s mom said, putting a hand on Winnie&#x2019;s knee. &#x201c;But don&#x2019;t worry. We have a very sensible plan for how to divide your time equally between the two of us.&#x201d;<br><br>Winnie&#x2019;s dad put a hand on Winnie&#x2019;s other knee. &#x201c;Exactly evenly,&#x201d; he told her.<br><br>For the next half an hour, Winnie sat precisely between her two parents, with one of their hands on each of her knees, as they explained their very sensible plan for her future.<br><br>They&#x2019;d found an unusual street, they told Winnie, a &#x201c;real gold mine,&#x201d; called Circle Road, just one block over from Winnie&#x2019;s uncle Huck&#x2019;s house.<br><br>Winnie scratched a little harder at Buttons&#x2019;s neck.<br><br>Circle Road, Winnie&#x2019;s parents explained, looped around on itself in a tiny circle, so that there was just enough space for two houses.<br><br>Winnie stroked Buttons&#x2019;s soft belly.<br><br>Winnie&#x2019;s mom would live in the two-story Colonial on the northernmost end of the circle, and Winnie would stay with her on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Fridays.<br><br>Winnie caressed the base of Buttons&#x2019;s ears, just the way he liked.<br><br>Her dad would live on the southernmost side of the street, in the yellow split-level (which might have&nbsp;<i>seemed&nbsp;</i>smaller than Winnie&#x2019;s mom&#x2019;s house, he informed his daughter, but was technically bigger, because of the square footage of the basement). Winnie would stay with him on Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.<br><br>Winnie rubbed under Buttons&#x2019;s orange chin.<br><br>Both houses had sprawling backyards, they went on, which backed up onto each other.<br><br>Winnie nestled her cheek in the soft fur at the base of Buttons&#x2019;s neck.<br><br>And at the exact center of Circle Road, her parents said, smack in between the two houses&#x2014;and definitely&nbsp;<i>not&nbsp;</i>(they&#x2019;d checked) on either parent&#x2019;s property&#x2014;was an enormous linden tree, with thick branches that reached in all directions. That&#x2019;s where Winnie would stay on Wednesdays.<br><br>Winnie must&#x2019;ve squeezed Buttons a little too tightly then, because he let out an angry&nbsp;<i>mew!</i><br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to live in a&nbsp;<i>tree</i>?&#x201d; Winnie asked her parents. It was the first thing she&#x2019;d said in thirty minutes.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be ridiculous,&#x201d; her mom said.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be in a&nbsp;<i>treehouse</i>,&#x201d; her dad clarified. &#x201c;Your uncle Huck has already agreed to design it.&#x201d;<br><br>Hearing that made Winnie and Buttons feel a little bit better, because Uncle Huck was both an amazing uncle and a fabulous architect. (He was also the one who&#x2019;d taught Winnie all about Artist Vision, which was something that would definitely come in handy later.) But still . . .<br><br>&#x201c;You really want me to live in a treehouse&nbsp;<i>every Wednesday</i>?&#x201d; Winnie asked, glancing from her mom to her dad and back again. &#x201c;All by myself?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the only way to split things evenly,&#x201d; her dad replied. &#x201c;Since every week has seven days in it. Seven, you know, is not an even number.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Winnie&#x2019;s mom said. &#x201c;We went over and over it. That&#x2019;s the only way it works. Three days with your father, three days with me, and one day on your own. Doesn&#x2019;t that sound like a very sensible plan?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Um . . . ,&#x201d; Winnie began, glancing from her dad to her mom and back again. Buttons wasn&#x2019;t quite sure how he felt about things, either. &#x201c;I guess?&#x201d; she said at last.<br><br>&#x201c;I knew you&#x2019;d think so,&#x201d; her dad said with a smile. &#x201c;It was my idea, after all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Your&nbsp;</i>idea?&#x201d; Winnie&#x2019;s mom cried. &#x201c;I very much disagree with&nbsp;<i>that&nbsp;</i>statement, Varun.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, do you?&#x201d; Winnie&#x2019;s dad said. &#x201c;What a shock, Alexis, that you feel the need to disagree with me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll disagree with you when you take claim to&nbsp;<i>my&nbsp;</i>proposals, Varun.&#x201d;<br><br>As her parents continued their argument, Winnie scooped up Buttons and headed down the hallway to her room. Neither of her parents seemed to notice that she&#x2019;d left. Winnie shut the door on their bickering, thinking that perhaps it wouldn&#x2019;t be so bad after all, having one day a week to herself.</p><h2>Moon Spotlight Detroit &amp; Ann Arbor</h2><p><i>Moon Spotlight Detroit &amp; Ann Arbor</i> is a 110-page compact guide covering the best of Southern Michigan, including Detroit's treasured Belle Isle and one-of-a-kind The Henry Ford, the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, and the W.K.

Check out his message to fans, and the artwork below. <i>--Daphne Durham</i><br><br> <strong>A Special Message about <i>Just Like Heaven</i></strong><br> <i>from New York Times Bestselling Author, Patrick McDonnell</i><br><br> I have spent the last twelve years as the creator of the newspaper comic strip <i>Mutts</i>. <i>Mutts</i> is centered on the unlikely friendship between Earl the dog and Mooch the cat. It combines my love for animals with my love for the art of the comic strip.<br><br> Becoming a daily cartoonist was something I always dreamed of doing, as was creating children's books. I love the timeless magic found in the best children's books. Like comic strips, its art is rooted in telling stories with words and pictures. Both forms have simplicity, poetry and optimism. Arts that spread joy.<br><br> I had the pleasure to do my first picture book last Fall when Little, Brown published <i>The Gift of Nothing</i>. It features Earl and Mooch. It was fun to tell a self-contained, complete story with characters I live with every day.<br><br> I followed <i>The Gift of Nothing</i> with <i>Art</i>, a book about a boy obsessed with making art and messes--a somewhat autobiographical love poem to the creative process.<br><br> My new book is titled <i>Just Like Heaven</i>. With this book I wanted to celebrate our everyday lives and the things we tend to take for granted, such as nature, birds, flowers, friends and family. It is loosely based on a two week story I once did in <i>Mutts</i>.<br><br> Some of the comic strips from that story are included here. While Mooch takes a nap under a tree, a deep fog quietly rolls in. Awakening in a cloud of mist, Mooch concludes that he must be in heaven. With his cat curiosity, he proceeds to explore his surroundings and sees the familiar in a whole new light:<br><br> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <br> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> <br> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> <br> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> <br> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> <br><i>Mutts � Patrick McDonnell, distributed by King Features Syndicate</i> </td> </tr> </tbody></table><br> <p> I hope the book is uplifting, inspiring and will be something to cuddle up to with your two legged--and perhaps your four legged--little friends. <i>--Patrick McDonnell</i> </p><p> </p>Patrick McDonnell is the creator of the Mutts comic strip, which recently celebrated its tenth anniversary.

She was born in Virginia and &nbsp;now lives with her family on a tropical island&nbsp;off the southwest coast of Florida where she spends her time writing and dodging hurricanes.Gr 7 Up&#x2014;This beautifully written coming-of-age story traces the lives of two girls whose worlds intersect on September 11, 2001. Chapters alternate between the present-day story of Jesse, whose brother died on that fateful day, and an emotional account of Muslim teen Alia's experience inside one of the beleaguered Twin Towers. The wounds are so deep that Jesse's family doesn't talk about her brother Travis. Her parents are on the brink of a divorce, and she has feelings for a bad boy who leads her astray. After her arrest for hate speech tagging, she is sentenced to community service at the Islam Peace Center. Alia is a teenage girl and aspiring comic book writer/illustrator. An incident at school causes her parents to withdraw permission for Alia to attend a program for talented high school artists. On September 11, she heads to her father's office at the World Trade Center to plead with him to change his mind. Jesse's journey to discover why Travis was at the Twin Towers and what happened to him before he died eventually leads her to a search for Alia, the girl Travis was with when the planes hit. Her work at the Islam Peace Center and the friends she makes there instill in Jesse a new understanding of Muslims and the Islamic faith.

Close to the action, he recorded it with unusual candor, directing his sorrow, frustration, and occasional anger to all parties involved&#x2014;the Tribal Council, the Justice Department, the BIA, FBI, and AIM. His account of the besiegers and besieged reveals a well-meaning and intelligent man forced by dramatic events to reevaluate some long-cherished assumptions.

Tourists are drawn to the stunning blend of classical, Gothic, and Renaissance-inspired architecture across the picturesque towns and villages, the charming open-air markets, the mouthwatering traditional cuisine, and of course, the famous gondolas drifting down the twinkling blue waters. While these gondolas, along with the time-honored models of the Venetian vessels docked in the harbors, are one of the city's most defining landmarks, their beginnings are shrouded in a more obscure part of Venetian history. <br>Founded in the wake of the decline of the Roman Empire, the Republic of Venice lasted for more than a thousand years, from 697-1797, and in order to understand its singular position in world history, it is necessary to first note its geographical positioning and its topographical make-up: Located in northeastern Italy at the head of the Adriatic, the city is made up of 120 islands that are connected by 430 bridges that cross over 170 canals, referred to as a &#x201c;rio&#x201d; or plural &#x201c;rii&#x201d; (Italian for river). As a maritime power, the interests of Venice once reached all the way to Asia, which allowed it to form an important crossroads within the Eastern Mediterranean, in terms of trade. In Venice, a vast array of products (raw materials, spices, cloth) came all the way from North Africa, Russia, and India and were exchanged for the goods and wealth of Europe.&#x201d; <br>In a country that is as crowded with famous cities as Italy, Genoa is usually not one that first leaps to mind, at least for an English-speaking audience. If Venice, Florence, and Rome are the top three, they are often followed by Pisa, Sienna, and Naples, not to mention the islands of Sardinia and Sicily. Indeed, Genoa would come towards the end of a much longer list, and it might be most closely associated with its famous native son, Christopher Columbus, who ultimately sailed for Spain. For avid tourists, Genoa might be the port of call for those wishing to visit the stunning Cinque Terre on the Ligurian coast nearby, and for an expert in world politics, the city of Genoa might recall the memories of the tragic events of the 27th G8 summit in July 2001, when, at the height of the anti-globalization movement, protests turned violent and resulted in the death of a 23-year-old Carlo Giuliani. In today&#x2019;s news, Genoa might represent Italy&#x2019;s crumbling infrastructure and the apparent powerlessness of its government to repair it - on Tuesday, August 14, 2018, one of the main bridges of the city, the Morandi Bridge, collapsed, killing 43 people and leaving 600 homeless. The bridge&#x2019;s demise also destroyed Italy&#x2019;s reputation as an expert in mechanical engineering.<br>Although Genoa cannot compete in the popular imagination with some of Italy&#x2019;s more famous cities, this busy port town perched above the sea once boasted a powerful empire that rivaled that of Venice. It also lasted for roughly the same time period, rising in the early Middle Ages and coming to an end at the hands of Napoleon Bonaparte near the end of the 18th century. Beyond its own success, the city&#x2019;s position at the head of the Mediterranean gave it an important strategic location from which to observe Italian and European history, as well as the world beyond. Today, historians are starting to correct the imbalance that has focused on Venice, Florence and Rome, and new histories are gradually introducing Genoa to the world, even as much remains to be uncovered. <br>The Republic of Venice and Republic of Genoa: The History of the Italian Rivals and their Mediterranean Empires looks at the origins of the cities, their rise to power across the Mediterranean, and their inevitable demises.</p><p></p><h2>Mink, Vol. 5</h2><p>When Mink finds an illegal software disc from the future that allows her to become whomever she wants, she creates a Cyber pop-star version of herself; however, she cannot tell anybody who she really is for fear of deletion.</p><p></p><h2>How to Prepare a Historic Racing Mini</h2><p>Ever since its launch in 1959 the original Mini has been a stalwart of the motor racing scene.&nbsp; Even today, there is a bewildering array of formulae that it can compete in.&nbsp; This book explains how to prepare a historic mini to the original pre-1966 Appendix K standard, which provides the racer with the largest choice of national and international events to compete in.&nbsp; Contents include regulations and safety; sourcing a suitable car; every aspect of preparation including body, engine, transmission, electrics and ancillaries; setting up and race preparation and testing and racing.</p><p><p><br>Since the 1980s, CCK Historic has been one of the UK's foremost historic racing car preparation specialists, whose cars are regularly seen at race meetings across the UK.&nbsp; CCK restored a historic Mini to racing condition specially for this book, in conjuction with Mini Sport.<br></p></p><h2>The Wartime Scrapbook: From Blitz to Victory 1939-1945</h2><p>An extraordinary collection of wartime ephemera.</p><p>He is the author of numerous publications and has given many talks to schools, as well as on radio and television.</p><h2>Cave birds: An alchemical cave drama</h2><p>Part of Ted Hughes&#39;s poem sequence Cave Birds was first published in a limited edition in 1975 by the Scolar Press as a magnificent portfolio containing both fine reproductions of drawings by leonard Baskin and a number of facsimiles of the poet&#39;s work-sheets.

In this book, Stuart Hampshire argues that no individual and no modern society can avoid conflicts between incompatible moral interests. Philosophers have tried in the past to find some underlying moral idea of justice which could resolve these conflicts and would be valid for any society. Hampshire claims that there can be no such thing. States can be held together, and war between them avoided, only by respect for the political process itself, and it is in these terms that justice must be defined. </p><p> The book closely examines the critical relationship between morality and justice, paying particular attention to Hume's moral subjectivism (which Hampshire disputes) and proposing a reply to Machiavelli's claim that the realities of politics inevitably oblige leaders to choose between unavoidable evils. </p><p> Most academic and moral philosophy, Hampshire argues, has been a fairy tale, representing ideals of private innocence rather than the realities of public experience. Conflicts between incompatible moral interests are as unavoidable in social and international arenas as they are in the lives of individuals. Philosophers, politicians, and theologians have all looked for an underlying moral consensus that will be valid for any just society. But the diversity of the human species and important differences in how various cultures define the good life militate against the formation of any such consensus. Ultimately, conflicts can be mediated only by respect for procedural justice. </p><p> Hampshire believes that themes of moral philosophy come from the writer's own experience, and he has given a brief but compelling account of his own life to help the reader understand the sources of his philosophy. Combining intellectual rigor with imaginative power, in <i>Innocence and Experience</i> Stuart Hampshire vividly illuminates the tensions between justice and other sources of value in society and in the life of the individual. </p></p><p>In this book, Stuart Hampshire argues that no individual and no modern society can avoid conflicts between incompatible moral interests.

And we need her now more than ever. Who has a voice like hers, able to penetrate so deep into the roots of life's pain and awkwardness and sometime beauty?

"Rumors were he was a tuba player, a lumberjack, a rabbi." "And the woman, because she is sentimental but cautious with her emotions, will say without conviction, I hear they were a family who summered at the beach, who lost their mother, who thought many things and then forgot them...." You see? And there is more, so much more, verve and sadness and guts and comedy and truth. To read this book is to plunge headlong into life itself.</p><p>--Peter Orner</p><p><em>Under the Music </em>is cause for celebration, as it gathers over forty years of Maxine Chernoff's brilliant exploration of a single form: the prose poem. Chernoff, also a writer of fiction, is a marvelous storyteller with impeccable comedic timing. Her pieces abound in witty dialogue, absurdist jokes, sage advice, and a gallery of eccentric characters like "The Man Struck Twenty Times by Lightning," or "The Woman Who Straddled the Globe." There is even a poignant conversation between Martin Heidegger and Hannah Arendt. Brief as these poems are, there is a vastness to the project. By acquiescing to the modest confines of this form, Chernoff discovers a seemingly endless reservoir of curiosity, invention, and delight.</p><p>--Elaine Equi</p><p>In one of these wonderfully inventive, witty prose poems, a child says "words are the finest toys." For Maxine Chernoff they are that, certainly, playthings that are moved--seem often to move themselves--into fields of imaginative possibility. The results are brief narratives, capricious and unexpected, fables, though with more in common with Borges and Bun&#x303;uel than La Fontaine. Chernoff has written and published prose poems for 40 years, reinventing the form into a space where the agile, speculative mind holds sway. Words and the things clutch at, verbal gesturings, implicit characters, all reckoned with in a remarkably clear, direct prose style that leaves, as the best of play always does, their magics in place.</p><p>--Michael Anania</p><p> </p></p><h2>Hadassah: One Night With the King</h2><p>Vibrantly brings to life the extraordinary story of Hadassah, a beautiful peasant girl who, after chosen to become Esther, queen of Persia, gains favor with the king and saves her people, in an exciting historical novel set in pre-Islamic Persia.</p><p><b>POWERFUL FICTION FEATURING ONE OF THE BIBLE'S MOST BELOVED CHARACTERS!<br><br></b>Against a vividly painted historical backdrop, bestselling author Tommy Tenney breathes new life into the age-old story of Hadassah, the simple peasant girl who must vie with more than a hundred other young women to become the next queen of Persia.

Best known for his novels ( Leviathan ), Auster describes in interviews how he began his literary career as a translator of poetry who eventually progressed to prose. The essays and prefaces are about "writers I felt a need to respond to"--including the well-known (Kafka), the less-known (Norwegian novelist Knut Hamsun and French poet Paul Celan) and the obscure (American poets Charles Reznikoff and Laura Riding). Auster's interest in the French language emerges in his substantial essay on 20th-century French poetry and in his exploration of the work of Louis Wolfson, an American schizophrenic who wrote in French because he found English "intolerably painful." The literary subjects discussed here may be out of the mainstream, but Auster is an erudite and engaged guide. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Applying UML and Patterns: An Introduction to Object-oriented Analysis and Design and Iterative Development</h2><p>This third edition presents a well-defined roadmap so the reader can move along a step-by-step process from requirements gathering all the way to code generation.

It&#x2019;s gold. Solid gold.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack Howard twisted around and stared at the orange glow of the headlamp from the other diver below him, the form almost completely obscured by the swirling black cloud of sediment that filled the tunnel. He dumped air from his buoyancy compensator and dropped down, flexing his knees to prevent his fins from scraping the jagged lava wall, then angled sideways to avoid becoming entangled in the cable that snaked up to the submersible on the seafloor above them. He injected a blast of air into his suit to reacquire neutral buoyancy, catching a glimpse of Costas&#x2019;s face through his visor as he finned sideways to let Jack take his place. Costas was staring intently at the tunnel wall in front of him, aiming his headlamp at one spot. Jack followed his gaze, edging forward, keeping his breathing shallow to maintain his depth in the water, staring into the swirl of sediment. Slowly the particles settled, and he began to make out the wall beyond. He could see the twisted black lava from the eruption five years ago, its friable surface broken and exposed by the boring drill that had dug through the solidified flow the day before to create the tunnel. But then he saw something different, embedded in the lava, a smooth rock surface cracked and mottled by the searing heat of the eruption. He peered at the polished surface, his heart suddenly pounding with excitement. There was no doubt about it. He was looking at a pillar, on some kind of plinth. A pillar carved by human hands.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; He punched his fist in the water, then turned to Costas, speaking into his intercom. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d begun to wonder whether this place really existed at all, or if it was just a figment of our imagination.&#x201d; He turned back to the pillar, seeing where the plinth had been carved out of the natural tufa. He had a flashback to the moment he and Costas had first seen archaeological remains at this site five years ago from the Aquapod submersibles, watching in awe as the veils of silt dropped and the walls and roofs of the ancient city appeared, the most exhilarating moment to date in his career as an underwater archaeologist. Revisiting scenes of past triumph was sometimes a strange experience, recalling emotions and high drama long gone, but this time it was different, like entering a completely new world. The volcanic eruption that had engulfed the site and forced them to leave five years ago had created a totally unfamiliar environment, a seascape as barren and devoid of life as the surface of the moon. He turned to Costas. &#x201c;This is the first proof we&#x2019;ve had it was all real. You&#x2019;re right. It&#x2019;s archaeological gold.&#x201d;<br><br>Costas tapped his shoulder, and aimed his headlamp midway up the wall above the plinth. &#x201c;Jack, I meant real gold. Have another look.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack followed Costas&#x2019;s beam and took a deep breath, holding it for a moment to rise a foot and a half in the water. The beam lit up a final swirl of volcanic particles that obscured the pillar, and Jack put out his hand and wafted them away. He let his hand drop, and then gasped in amazement. &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;ll be damned,&#x201d; he whispered.<br><br>&#x201c;See what I mean?&#x201d;<br><br>Jack stared, wondering whether his imagination was playing tricks on him. The object in front of him was remarkably similar to one they had found five years ago, the object that had first led them to this place. He saw the reflected shimmer of gold on the inside of his visor, and he closed his eyes for a moment, half expecting it to be a phantasm, to be gone when he opened them. But it was still there, a golden disk about a hand&#x2019;s breadth across embedded in the pillar, the sheen of gold almost blinding him in the reflected glare of the headlamp. He reached out and carefully pressed the fingers of his glove against it, feeling the solidity. It was real. He felt the adrenaline course through him, and turned and grinned at Costas. &#x201c;Now I really believe it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the Atlantis symbol, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br><br>Atlantis. It was the first time either of them had uttered the word since leaving Seaquest II in the submersible two hours before, as if to say it aloud would risk the site closing up on them again. Jack searched with his eyes, seeing nothing but the golden reflection. &#x201c;Where are you looking?&#x201d;<br><br>Costas turned his head to move his beam away. &#x201c;Use your headlamp, angled down, low beam. You should get more shadow.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack reached up to his helmet and activated the twin halogen lamps on either side, then ramped them down. Suddenly a symbol appeared on the disk, its lines deeply impressed into the gold. He stared in astonishment, his mind racing back to the extraordinary events of five years ago, to the excavation of a Bronze Age wreck in the Aegean Sea at the start of their quest. They had found a golden disk impressed with this symbol, alongside other symbols Jack had recognized from an ancient pottery disk found a century before at the Minoan site of Phaistos in Crete. The Phaistos symbols had baffled archaeologists for generations, but the disk from the wreck contained parallel symbols in the Minoan Linear script, an early form of Greek, which allowed the Phaistos symbols to be translated.<br><br>What they had revealed was astounding, the greatest revelation from an ancient text in the history of archaeology. One word had stood out, a word that had bedeviled archaeologists since time immemorial, a word spelled out in the syllabic script of the Minoans and represented by the symbol in front of Jack now: Atlantis. That had been remarkable enough, but then his colleague Maurice Hiebermeyer had made another discovery deep in the Egyptian desert, a fragment of papyrus showing that the story of Atlantis told by the Greek philosopher Plato had not been a myth but was based on hard reality, on an account given to a Greek traveler by an Egyptian priest who had inherited secret knowledge stretching back thousands of years before the first pharaohs. Together the papyrus and the disk contained clues that had brought Jack and his team to the southeastern corner of the Black Sea, searching a shoreline submerged when the Mediterranean had cascaded over a land bridge at the present-�day Bosporus and filled the Black Sea basin, the last and most catastrophic event in the sea-�level rise caused by the great melt at the end of the Ice Age twelve thousand years ago. For Jack, it had been the perfect archaeological quest, a marriage of textual clues, hard science, and intuition, and it had brought together all the skills of his team. They had revealed nothing short of the most dramatic archaeological site ever discovered, surrounding the twin peaks of a partly submerged volcano. It had been a spectacular vision of human ingenuity and achievement at the beginning of the Neolithic period, when people had built monuments that equaled those of the Egyptians and the Sumerians and the Mesoamericans thousands of years later.<br><br>Jack traced his glove over the symbol on the disk, up the central axis to where two symmetrical patterns extended outward like garden rakes, each terminating in a series of parallel lines. The text on the Phaistos disk had instructed them to follow the shape of the eagle with outstretched wings, and they had realized that the symbol was also a map, a plan of the submerged tunnels and chambers they had discovered under the peak of the volcano. Five years ago they had passed through extraordinary wonders: a huge chamber full of ancient cave paintings of the Ice Age, then a tunnel with carvings showing latter-�day priests of Atlantis with conical hats, and then the holy of holies, the place where the tunnel ahead of them now might be leading. Yet that chamber with its huge statue of a mother goddess had been freshly carved shortly before the flood, and Jack was convinced that somewhere inside the tunnels and chambers lay other secrets, something that would link the holy of holies and the priests with those ancestral images from the Ice Age: perhaps an inner sanctum that would reveal how the belief system of the Ice Age hunter-�gatherers had transformed into a religion of priests and gods and worship. The most likely location, the complex of tunnels ahead of them now, was a place they had only just begun to explore five years ago when the North Anatolian Fault had shuddered and the volcano surged to life again, forcing them away from the site seemingly forever.<br><br>Jack pressed his hand against the surface of the disk, wishing he could remove his glove and feel it against his skin. He had found gold before: gleaming coins of the Roman emperors, dazzling cups and jewelry on the Bronze Age wreck, gold fit for a king. But this disk was extraordinarily old, at least as old as the flooding of Atlantis more than seven thousand years ago. That was three thousand years before the earliest site elsewhere to produce worked gold, at Varna in Bulgaria. The gold in the disk could have come here with the first hunter-�gatherers who had sought shelter in the caves on the slopes of the volcano during the Ice Age, who had painted the rock with images of mammoths and fearsome lions and leopards: a band of humans of precocious intellect and vision who had traveled south from the retreating glaciers with their most precious belongings. Their talent with metals was clear, their ability to collect and work copper and then to make an alloy to produce bronze, thousands of years before bronze technology reemerged and became widespread in the ancient world. They could have brought the gold with them from the nearest rich source, the gold-�bearing streams of the Caucasus Mountains to the east, laying woolly mammoth skins in the water and collecting the precious flecks just as the Greek myths had Jason and the Argonauts do with the Golden Fleece. And they could have smelted and fashioned the gold into a disk bearing their sacred symbol, perhaps at the time they were transforming their world&#x2014;�moving beyond the natural caves in the volcano by cutting their own passageways and chambers in the rock, then fashioning mud, brick, lime, and volcanic ash into the walls of houses, creating the world&#x2019;s first civilization.<br><br>To Jack, the golden disk represented everything that was fascinating about this place: the symbol of a people on the cusp of the greatest revolution in human history, a symbol that allowed them to look forward to a new world and yet also back to the time of their ancestors. He wanted to feel what they had felt, to see the world as they had seen it, to look far back in prehistory to the time before the memory of the deep past had become clouded by the foundation myths that followed the first cities and the first dynasties; and he wanted to look forward to where these people were going, to understand what motivated them as they poured all their energy into creating this place and then fleeing the oncoming flood. If he could see those things, then he would have found the greatest treasure of this place. He wanted to discover their past. Above all, he wanted to find out about their beliefs, how these people saw their existence at the dawn of modern religion. He wanted to find the gods of Atlantis.<br><br>Costas tapped Jack&#x2019;s helmet. &#x201c;You happy?&#x201d;<br><br>Jack drew his eyes away from the symbol and looked at Costas, his form now visible as the sediment cleared. Beneath a tattered boilersuit filled with tools, Costas was completely encased in white, like an astronaut. His helmet bore the anchor logo of the International Maritime University, partly obscured by a laser range-�finding device that he had spirited away from the engineering department, one of numerous gadgets that always festooned him when he went diving. Underneath the white outer layer they were both wearing e-�suits, Kevlar-�reinforced dry suits with integrated buoyancy systems, back-�mounted oxygen rebreathers, and dive computers with readouts visible inside their helmets. But the famed environmental resilience of the e-�suit did not extend to diving in near-�boiling water inside an active volcano, so they were entirely encased in thermal protection developed at IMU from the latest NASA and Russian spacesuit technology. Jack had to remind himself that they were not inside some lunar simulator, but under the Black Sea off Turkey, more than a hundred feet below a solidified lava flow and heading for a place that made outer space seem distinctly congenial.</p><h2>Terns</h2><p>Covering 22 species found in the Western Paleartic and North America, this guide lists each species under the sections of: field identification; moult; description; geographical variation; measurements; and weight.

She lives in Waukegan, Illinois.<br>Don't be put off by the dark, forbidding cover of this latest thriller in Bland's popular Marti MacAlister series, because the story is gripping from the opening sentence through its chilling final scene. African-American detective Marti and partner Matthew Jessenovik investigate a 20-year killing spree where victims' severed hands are found protruding from the ground, "fingers curled in a beckoning gesture." Their quest for the perp runs through Chicago's ethnic neighborhoods, encountering the plagues of urban America today: prostitution, drug addiction, AIDS and, inevitably, murder. A look at the origins of some of these intractable problems takes us back to a '70s hippie commune where one of Chicago society's daughters sought refuge after her mother's suicide. Beyond a simple murder case, the novel becomes an engrossing story of the ever more violent conflicts between society's "insiders and the excluded," and Bland's obvious familiarity with urban issues lends credibility to her riveting style. She deftly interweaves a subplot involving Marti's best friend, who's entangled in a terrifying relationship with a serial killer who lures her, and later her unsuspecting teenage daughter, to the Bahamas just before a hurricane nearly destroys the islands. While much blood is spilled in this despairing tale, it is never graphic or sensational, but rather gives an authentic feeling of life in the urban abyss. The last page shows disturbingly how the cycle of violence will continue unabated. Agent, Ted Chichak.

There is some record of San Vicente in FBI records during the Wilson era, and some mention of him in anarchist records and rumors, but the rest has to be filled in.

Casting himself in a tale set 29 years before he was born, Taibo chronicles his present-day research and depicts a range of first-person characters (some of them real figures) who engage with the elusive anarchist. His first creation is a 16-year-old orphan called Pablo, who meets San Vicente as the anarchist arrives in Tampico from the U.S. in 1920. On the run from the FBI, San Vicente immediately plunges into revolutionary agitation in the port city, supporting himself as a mechanic. Taking Pablo under his wing, he initiates the boy into the mysteries of engine repair and the writings of the revolutionary Bakunin. But soon San Vicente makes his way to Mexico City, where he falls in with the CGT, an opposition labor union. Narrowly escaping an assassination attempt (the would-be assassin is another first-person Taibo elaboration), he becomes a secretary for the group. In 1921, he is arrested with an American Communist, Richard Francis Phillips, and deported to Guatemala. But San Vicente is soon back in Mexico, where more activism and a final arrest result in his deportation to Spain in 1922, marking his last appearance on the historical record.

Given that history, it&#x2019;s no surprise that New Yorkers have always wanted to construct the biggest and best structures possible, even in the early 1930s at the height of the Great Depression. Indeed, those years produced the Empire State Building, which remains the city&#x2019;s most iconic building, but New York&#x2019;s most famous skyscraper wouldn&#x2019;t have been possible without the Chrysler Building, a landmark in its own right that was the tallest building in the world for nearly a year before its more famous counterpart&#x2019;s completion. In fact, the spirit of competition between the groups working on the two buildings helped ensure that both look like they do today, and the Chrysler Building only reached the height it did because a large skyscraper at 40 Wall Street was also trying to claim the mantle of tallest building at the same time. The Chrysler Building was the first man-made object to surpass 1,000 feet in height, and while it has been surpassed by considerably taller projects since, it remains the largest steel-supported brick building in the world. As its name suggests, the Chrysler Building was named after Walter P. Chrysler, who ran the car company at the time, and yet his corporation never owned the building because he cherished it so much that he personally paid for the skyscraper and kept it in his family. Although it has since been sold to new groups, the name has remained, and the Chrysler Building continues to be a conspicuous part of the skyline in Midtown.

And many, as <i>Saints Behaving Badly</i> reveals, were made of very rough materials indeed. The first book to lay bare the less than saintly behavior of thirty-two venerated holy men and women, it presents the scandalous, spicy, and sleazy detours they took on the road to sainthood.<br><br>In nineteenth- and twentieth-century writings about the lives of the saints, authors tended to go out of their way to sanitize their stories, often glossing over the more embarrassing cases with phrases such as, &#x201c;he/she was once a great sinner.&#x201d; In the early centuries of the Church and throughout the Middle Ages, however, writers took a more candid and spirited approach to portraying the saints. Exploring sources from a wide range of periods and places, Thomas Craughwell discovered a veritable rogues gallery of sinners-turned-saint. There&#x2019;s St. Olga, who unleashed a bloodbath on her husband&#x2019;s assassins; St. Mary of Egypt, who trolled the streets looking for new sexual conquests; and Thomas Becket, who despite his vast riches refused to give his cloak to a man freezing to death in the street. <br><br>Written with wit and respect (each profile ends with what inspired the saint to give up his or her wicked ways) and illustrated with amusing caricatures, <i>Saints Behaving Badly</i> will entertain, inform, and even inspire Catholic readers across America.</p><p>THOMAS J.

But antitax animosity was especially intense in ancient Israel during the first century of the Christian era. In the gospels tax collectors (also known as publicans) are frequently mentioned in the same breath as harlots and sinners.<br><br>If tax collectors had a lousy reputation two thousand years ago, they deserved it. Under the Romans, the governor of each province was responsible for collecting the tax on land. Other taxes--on individuals, on personal property, on imports and exports--were subcontracted to private individuals who paid the Romans a fee in advance for the right to collect whatever Rome had levied on the conquered nations of its empire. These freelance tax collectors profited from this transaction by overcharging and extorting as much as they could get out of the taxpayers. The Romans didn't care--as long as they got the full balance of what was due. The Jews, on the other hand, cared quite a lot. In their eyes Jewish tax collectors were shameless crooks who committed the twofold crime of collaborating with heathens and preying upon their own people. Little wonder that the Jews of Christ's day regarded tax collectors with loathing.<br><br>Matthew, also called Levi in the gospels of St. Mark and St. Luke, was a tax collector at Capernaum, a Roman garrison town. He was sitting at his table in the customs house, shaking down his neighbors, when Jesus Christ walked by. Our Lord had just healed a paralyzed man; now he was about to reconcile a sinner. "Follow me," Christ said. To the surprise of the Roman guards, the clerks, and the taxpayers, Matthew got up, left the money where it lay on the table, turned his back on a life of government-sanctioned larceny, and joined the handful of men we know as the twelve apostles.<br><br>St. Luke's gospel tells us that Matthew celebrated his conversion by throwing an elaborate feast for Christ, the apostles, and a host of other guests. When the Pharisees complained that Jesus had no business dining with a notorious tax collector, Christ answered, "I came not to call the just, but sinners."<br><br>This is the only scene in the New Testament in which Matthew takes the spotlight.<br><br>From a very early date Christians attributed one of the gospels to St. Matthew. Although it comes first in the New Testament, in all probability St. Mark's is the oldest gospel, which almost certainly served as a source for Matthew. Matthew wrote for a Jewish audience; in his gospel he quotes frequently from the Hebrew scriptures to emphasize that Christ is the fulfillment of the prophecies. We owe to Matthew such unique features as St. Joseph's plan to divorce the Blessed Virgin Mary, the coming of the Magi to Bethlehem, King Herod's slaughter of the Holy Innocents, the Holy Family's flight into Egypt, a great part of the Sermon on the Mount, the parable of the sower, the metaphor of the sheep and the goats at the Last Judgment, the suicide of Judas, and the guards at Christ's tomb.<br><br>There is no reliable record of what Matthew did after the first Pentecost, when the apostles scattered to preach the gospel. He may have gone to Ethiopia, or to the region near the Caspian Sea--those two destinations appear most often in the old sources. There is even a dubious claim that St. Matthew went to Ireland. The truth is St. Matthew's later life is a mystery. Tradition says that he died a martyr, cut down with a sword as he said Mass. But we aren't even sure about that.<br>St. Dismas, Thief<br><i>[Died c. 30]&nbsp;&nbsp; FEAST DAY: March 25</i><br>Christ was crucified between two thieves--all four gospels bear witness to this. But St. Luke's gospel fleshes out the scene a bit, giving "the Good Thief," the man tradition names Dismas, a few lines of dialogue.<br><br>The scene opens with the three men hanging on their crosses. "The Bad Thief," the man tradition names Gestas, reviles Jesus, saying, "If thou be the Christ, save thyself and us." That's when Dismas speaks up. "Neither dost thou fear God, seeing thou art under the same condemnation? And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this man hath done no evil."<br><br>Then, addressing Christ, the dying Dismas says, "Lord, remember me when thou shalt come into thy kingdom."<br><br>Jesus replies, "Amen I say to thee, this day thou shalt be with me in paradise."<br><br>The scene is brief and poignant, and although the Good Thief doesn't say much, it is interesting to note that he has more lines than other, infinitely more popular New Testament saints. St. Jude, the enormously popular patron saint of impossible causes, is on record as speaking only once and very briefly in the gospels. Even stranger is the case of St. Joseph, Christ's foster father and the Blessed Virgin Mary's husband, who in the entire New Testament never says a single word.<br><br>From a very early date Christians found these silences and gaps in the stories of such significant players frustrating. An entire body of literature sprang up to answer the inevitable question "And then what happened?" The term for these narratives is apocrypha. They are writings that, in spite of their popularity with the early Christians, did not make it into the canon, the official list, of the books of the New Testament. Most of these works were omitted because they taught unorthodox doctrine (the so-called Gnostic gospels fall into this category). Other apocryphal works may have been perfectly orthodox in their understanding of the nature of Christ and his mission in the world but passed along stories about Mary's and Joseph's family backgrounds and the infancy and childhood of Christ that the early Church knew to be untrue or could not substantiate. The stories, or legends if you prefer, of St. Dismas are not theologically suspect, but it is certainly impossible at this point to say what, if anything, in these stories actually happened.<br><br>The earliest apocryphal work to attempt to flesh out the story of the Holy Family and St. Dismas is <i>The Arabic Gospel of the Infancy of the Savior</i>, dating from around 600. The book covers Mary and Joseph's journey into Egypt with the Christ Child to escape Judea's murderous King Herod, their return home to Nazareth a few years later, and Jesus' early childhood.<br><br>As Mary and Joseph wander through Egypt, looking for a safe place to call home, the local people warn them about a certain stretch of desert that is teeming with robbers. Hoping to pass without being detected, Mary and Joseph decide to travel by night. As they make their way through this dangerous territory, they see two highwaymen blocking the road ahead of them. Worse still, they realize that they have stumbled right into a robbers' camp: all around them dozens of cutthroats lie sleeping. The robbers watching the road are Dismas and Gestas.<br><br>Gestas is ready to get down to business and take anything of value the Holy Family has on them, but Dismas intervenes. "Let these persons go freely," Dismas says, "so that our comrades may not see them." It's a strange request from a hardened criminal, and Gestas dismisses it out of hand.<br>So Dismas makes his request more attractive. "Take to thyself these forty drachmas from me," Dismas says. Then he sweetens the deal by taking off his valuable belt and promising that to Gestas, too. The drachmas and the belt are an offer Gestas can't refuse, so he stands aside and lets the Holy Family go, free and unmolested.<br><br>Before they continue on their way, Mary prophesies to Dismas, "The Lord God will sustain thee by his right hand, and will grant thee remission of thy sins." But the Christ Child makes an even greater prophecy. "Thirty years hence, O my mother," he says, "these two robbers will be raised upon the cross along with me, Dismas on my right hand, and Gestas on my left: and after that day, Dismas shall go before me into paradise."<br><br>But this isn't the only ancient work to fill out the Dismas story. <i>The Gospel of Nicodemus</i>, a fourth-century apocryphal work, picks up Dismas's story where St. Luke's gospel leaves off. <i>The Gospel of Nicodemus</i> takes us down to the underworld during the three dark days Christ lay dead in his tomb.<br><br>According to Catholic theology, when Adam and Eve disobeyed God in Eden, the gates of Heaven were shut and would not be reopened until the Savior died and rose from the dead. During those long centuries the souls of the righteous went to Limbo, a level of Hell where they were spared the sufferings of the damned but were denied the beatific vision of God. When Christ descended into Hell, as the Apostles' Creed says, he liberated the souls of the just and led them to Heaven. In the Middle Ages this moment in the history of mankind's salvation was known as the Harrowing of Hell; it was a popular subject for mystery plays, with Christ entering like an all-powerful warlord ready to besiege a city. In spite of all the demons arrayed against him, Christ batters down the heavily fortified gates of Hell and releases the souls held captive there by the devil.<br><br>In<i> The Gospel of Nicodemus</i>, as the holy men and women who lived and died before the coming of Christ gather together for their long-awaited journey to Paradise, Enoch and Elijah see a man coming toward them dressed in vile clothes with the sign of the cross on his shoulders.<br><br>"Who art thou?" they ask, "for thine appearance is as of a robber; and wherefore is it that thou bearest a sign upon thy shoulders?"<br><br>The stranger is Dismas, of course, and he answers, "I was a robber, doing all manner of evil upon the earth. [But] I beheld the wonders in the creation which came to pass through the cross of Jesus when he was crucified, and I believed that he was the maker of all creatures and the almighty king, and I besought him, saying, 'Remember me, Lord, when thou comest into thy kingdom.' And forthwith he received my prayer, and said unto me, 'Verily I say unto thee, this day shalt thou be with me in paradise.' And he gave me the sign of the cross, saying: 'Bear this and go unto paradise.' "<br><br>At some point--when is hard to pinpoint--interest in St. Dismas segued into devotion. He became the patron saint of thieves specifically and criminals in general. The saint received a bit more attention in 1961 with the release of the movie <i>The Hoodlum Priest</i>, starring Don Murray as the tough-guy Jesuit Father Charles Dismas Clark, who served as a kind of missionary to street gangs and convicts. Under the patronage of St. Dismas, Catholic chaplains operate a ministry to incarcerated men and women.<br><br>As is often the case, we can see the depth of devotion to St. Dismas through the life of another saint. Father Emil Kapaun of Pilsen, Kansas, who is being promoted for sainthood, was a military chaplain during the Korean War. In November 1950 the North Koreans captured him and 1,200 American fighting men. The American POWs got so little food they were on the verge of starvation, so every night Father Kapaun crept out of the barracks to steal corn, millet, and soybeans from the guards' storehouse. Before Father Kapaun went out on his "foraging" forays, he prayed to St. Dismas, the Good Thief.<br>St. Callixtus, Embezzler<br><br><i><br>[Died 222]&nbsp;&nbsp; FEAST DAY: October 14</i><br>A remarkable number of contemporary sources tell the story of St. Callixtus, including the work of the second-century Christian historian Julius Africanus, compiler of the first Christian chronology. Most of the details of Callixtus's disorderly life, however, come from his two bitterest enemies, the Christian theologian and controversialist Tertullian and the antipope Hippolytus. They have left us a scrupulously detailed record of every one of Callixtus's transgressions. The only aspect of his life that Tertullian and Hippolytus shied away from was his conversion.<br><br>Around the year 190 in Rome a Christian named Carpophorus set up a bank for his fellow Christians, particularly widows, who needed a safe place to keep their limited funds. Carpophorus had a Christian slave named Callixtus who had experience managing money, so he entrusted the administration of the bank to him. The man couldn't have made a worse choice.<br><br>Callixtus's investment decisions were disastrous. Worse still, he had a habit of helping himself to the bank's funds. In short order all the money was gone. Roman Christians who thought they were financially secure suddenly found themselves destitute. As for Callixtus, he ran to the nearest harbor, where he booked passage on the first ship heading out to sea. The destination didn't matter, so long as the ship took him far from his irate master and the Christians he had bankrupted.<br><br>But Carpophorus went after his slave. He caught up with Callixtus at the town of Portus, where the runaway slave was aboard a ship anchored in the middle of the harbor, anxiously awaiting a favorable wind. Carpophorus hired a boatman to ferry him out to the vessel. As the little boat drew close, Callixtus recognized the man aboard as his master. In desperation he dove into the sea and tried to swim to safety. By now Carpophorus's boat was within earshot of the ship. He shouted to the sailors not to let Callixtus get away. The crew leapt into their own small boats, fished Callixtus out of the water, and handed him over to Carpophorus.<br><br>Under Roman law masters could do whatever they liked with their slaves. Back in Rome Carpophorus sentenced Callixtus to hard labor. The embezzling slave was chained to a gristmill, where he turned the massive stone wheel day after day. It was brutal, exhausting, mind-numbing work. Callixtus, knowing that his master would never forgive him, expected to turn the wheel until he dropped dead in his tracks.<br><br>Then rescue came from an unexpected quarter. The ruined depositors from Carpophorus's bank begged him to release Callixtus, arguing that the slave might be persuaded to recover at least some of the money he had squandered. The pleas of his desperate friends touched the heart of Carpophorus; he agreed to free his slave with the understanding that Callixtus would try to regain at least some of the money he had lost.<br><br>Callixtus was barely out of his chains when he got into fresh trouble. On Saturday morning he barged into Rome's synagogue, disrupted the Sabbath service, and demanded money from the Jewish congregation. He claimed he was trying get back the funds he had invested with Jewish financiers. This may have been true, but Callixtus should have known better than to disturb religious people at their prayers in order to collect a debt. The brawl that erupted in the synagogue ended with members of the congregation dragging Callixtus into the courtroom of Fuscianus, the prefect of the city.<br><br>The Jews charged Callixtus with disturbing the peace and desecrating a holy place. For good measure, they said they suspected that Callixtus was a member of that outlawed sect known as Christians. By now Carpophorus was in the courtroom, too, and he swore that his slave was no Christian. Technically, of course, Carpophorus was lying since Callixtus had been baptized. But in terms of Callixtus's conduct, no one could describe it as Christlike.</p><h2>Emergence of Rome As Ruler of the Western World</h2><p>Surveys the rise of Roman Europe from the arrival in Italy of the Etruscans and the Greeks</p><p></p><h2>Titansgrave The Ashes of Valkana</h2><p>You watched the show; now play the game!

He brings to the study of literature a fine and fresh critical intelligence that is always richly suggestive, never modish. He offers here an inquiry--elegant in conception and style--into the art of interpretation. His subject quite simply is meanings; how they are revealed and how they are concealed. </p><p> Drawing on the venerable traition of biblical interpretation, Mr. Kermode examines some enigmatic passages and episodes in the gospels. From his reading come ideas about what makes interpretation possible--and often impossible. He considers ways in which narratives aquire opacity, and he asks whether there are methods of distinguishing all possible meaning from a central meaning which gives the story its structure. He raises questions concerning the interpretation of single texts in relation to their context in a writer's work and a tradition; considers the special interpretative problems of historical narration; and tries to relate the activities of the interpreter to interpretation more broadly conceived as a means of living in the world. </p><p> While discussing the gospels, Mr. Kermode touches upon such literary works as Kafka's parables, Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>, Henry James's novels, and Pynchon's <i>Crying of Lot 49</i>. By showing the relationships between religious interpretation and literary criticism, he has enhanced both fields. </p></p><p><b>Frank Kermode</b> is Julian Clarence Levi Professor of English Literature, Columbia University, and a Fellow of King's College, Cambridge.&#34;The Gensis of Secrecy is important partly because of its method and partly because of its subject matter.

The temperature hovered around the freezing point, and a gusty wind drove frigid rain that sometimes turned to spits of snow in long plumes and swirls down the broad avenue. It was rush hour, and it seemed as if the entire city was tangled in one, large, snarled mess.Nevertheless, a few Parisians were strolling hand in hand through the Tuil�ries gardens, mindless of the weather, though none of the restaurants or vendors had their tables out.The tall, well-dressed man with the briefcase left the gardens,crossed the street, and made his way up the broad walk to an old, ornately designed four-story building, the roof of which bristled not only with chimneys, but also with aerials and a variety of satellite communications dishes. A brass plaque announced: EMBASSY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA."Good afternoon," the man said to the Marine guards just inside the main hall. He handed his briefcase to one of them and his American passport to the other. "I'd like to see a consular officer.""Mr. McGarvey?" the one Marine, whose name tag identified him as Selkirk, said, studying the passport."Yes, that's right. Kirk McGarvey. I live here in Paris," the man said, smiling pleasantly. He was well built and almost handsome in a rugged, outdoorsy way. His eyes were a startling green, and were wide and very direct. His accent sounded definitely East Coast, possibly Boston."You know that your passport has expired, sir?" Selkirk jotted down the number.The tall man nodded. "That's why I'm here. Silly of me, actually, that I didn't notice. I've been to Brussels on business for the past few days, and the border crossing people outside Valenciennes pointed it out. Thought I'd better come in and get it renewed or something."The other Marine, Danberg, had put the briefcase through the scanner, then handed it back. "You can see someone who'll fix you up just down the corridor to the right, sir," he said. He glanced up at the clock above the door. "But you'd better hurry. It's nearly six, and most of them are probably gone or on their way out by now.""I see," the imposter said, smiling. "But I suppose you boys will be here all night."Danberg shook his head. "No, sir. We get off in a couple of minutes ourselves.""Well, you'd better bundle up good. It's not very nice out there now.""Yes, sir."The man turned and walked across the big hall, his shoes making no sound on the marble floor. No one was around. The building seemed deserted. Halfway down the long corridor on the right, he passed a flight of stairs, exactly where he knew it would be from the blueprints he'd studied. At the end of thecorridor, he knocked once at the door with a frosted glass window, and went in.A counter ran the width of the room. Behind it was a large office with a half dozen desks, all but one of which were empty. An attractive woman in a red knit dress, a white scarf around her neck, her plastic security badge clipped beneath it, was speaking on the telephone. She looked up, did a double take, and then put a hand over the mouthpiece."Yes, sir, may I help you with something?" she asked. There was no one else in the office. Her red coat and her purse were lying on a chair in front of her desk."It's my passport," the imposter said carefully. Something was wrong here, but it was a calculated risk he'd had to take. "It's going to have to be renewed.""Is it urgent?""Not yet," the man said. "I could come back tomorrow if it would be better.""It would.""First thing?""Nineish.""Very good," the man said. "See you then." He turned and left the office. No one was around to see him hurry to the stairs and go up. He pulled off his gloves and overcoat, and before he reached the first-floor landing, he had clipped a security badge just like the woman's in the consular office to the lapel of his brown jacket. The badge identified him as a special assistant to the ambassador.The title and his name, of course, were not real. And had the woman known who he actually was, she would have run for her life.&nbsp;<br>Inside the consular office, Carley Webb put down the telephone, and gathered her coat and purse. Before she went out she scrawled a note about the man with the passport problem and left it on Cedric Evans's desk.There had been something oddly familiar about the man's face that had startled her for just a moment. So much so that she'd forgotten to get his name, but he'd be returning in the morning, so it didn't matter. In any event, it wasn't her job. Her work in the consular section was merely a cover for her assignment with the Central Intelligence Agency's Paris station,a position she had fought hard to get, and one she relished.There were many women on the staff, but no others were full-fledged case officers. Most of them worked as secretaries, or cipher clerks, or in a few instances as translators. The Paris station was the Company's largest operation in Europe, even bigger than Bonn, because this was the central clearinghouse for all information funneling back to Langley. She was resented by some of the women because of what she did, and partly because of her looks. At thirty-three she had lost her innocent little-girlishness and had developed into a sophisticated, even beautiful woman. In the right light she could have been mistaken for a young Audrey Hepburn, with her long delicate neck, small angular face, wide dark eyes, and slender frame.Just now she was finishing the developmental stages of new network that had been code-named SPARKLE. Contact had been made and was firmly established with two high-ranking officers in the Soviet embassy, one of them the third assistant to the KGB's Paris <i>rezident,</i> and the other the second assistant to the Soviet's military attache. Both of them were men, both of them had a crush on her, which of course she encouraged, but neither of them knew about the other. Each man thought he was working alone with her. The value of this particular network, aside from the obvious benefits of having such assets in the Soviet embassy, was that by working them both, she had a continual check on the veracity of the information they were providing her."The day will come, Carley, when they will want to make love to you," Thomas Lord, chief of station, had warned her.It hadn't happened yet, but with Vladimir Rudichev, the KGB officer, the moment was fast approaching."I'll deal with it when the time comes," she'd told Lord."Perhaps we should begin weaning you out. Stewart can gradually begin to take over.""Not yet, Tom. Please. Just give me a little longer."Lord had been like a brother, or even a father, to her from the moment she'd been transferred from Langley. He smiled. "Just be careful, kid. Will you at least do that much for me?""Sure," she'd promised. It was pride, of course. She'd come this far on her own; she didn't want to drop out just as the gold seam of information was beginning to produce results.Besides, she told herself, pulling on her coat as she headed down the corridor, Rudichev and Guryanov were not her only problem. She was going to have to make another decision, and in some respects an even larger one, very soon. Maybe even tonight.Nearly everyone had left early that afternoon because of the weather, though she supposed Lord would still be upstairs in his office. The afternoon summaries went out via encrypted burst transmission at seven, and he almost always stuck around to make last-minute additions or deletions. Fine tuning, he called it.She crossed the main hall and turned in her security badge to the Marines."Good night, Miss Webb," they said."'Night," she replied, starting for the door, but then she changed her mind and came back. "There was a tall, good-looking man in to see me about renewing his passport a few minutes ago. Did you get his name?" Because of terrorist attacks, U.S. embassies worldwide logged in visitors, carefully scrutinizing their parcels and papers."We just came on duty ourselves, ma'am," one of the Marines said. "Must have missed him."The other Marine had turned the registration book around so that he could read the last entries. "Here he is, last one in. Name is Kirk McGarvey.""Kirk, here?" she said. "I didn't see him."The young man shrugged. "That's what it says, Miss Webb. Logged in for the Consular Section at 1758 hours, briefcase checked.""That was only a few minutes ago," Carley said, her mind going to a dozen different possibilities but rejecting them all. "Who else came in, just before McGarvey?""Henri Perigord, also for the Consular Section. But that was much earlier, ma'am, 1527 hours."Carley remembered him. "No one else in between?""No, ma'am. Is something wrong?""I don't know," Carley said. "But the man who logged in at six wasn't the Kirk McGarvey I know.""Someone impersonating him?""Possibly," she said, glancing toward the elevators. "He said he'd be back in the morning. I'll check it out myself.""Anything else we can do in the meantime?"Carley had glanced at the registration book. Beside McGarvey's name, the Marine had written his passport number. It was something. She looked up. "If he returns tonight, give me a call. I'll be on my beeper.""Will do," the Marine said, and Carley turned and left the embassy. It was possible that the Marine who had logged the man in had made a mistake about his name. But she couldn't see how.It nagged at her as she hurried, head bent low against the wind, to catch a cab on the avenue Gabriel. But the man was gone. There was nothing to be done about it until morning.&nbsp;<br>The embassy's second-floor corridor was empty, but the imposter could hear the high-pitched whining sounds of a computer printer coming from somewhere above. He held up for a second or two just within the landing.Most of the diplomats and other embassy personnel would be gone already. But the CIA's communications center on the third floor would be fully manned, and some of the Agency's high-ranking officers would probably still be there, getting their seven o'clock summaries ready for transmission to the States.It was a bit of insider information that not many people knew; not secret, just not publicly known."What we need, Arkasha, is a diversion," the general had told him at their last meeting in Tripoli. "You are to be my chosen one for this work. I'm putting your skills to use again. Just like the old days. Only this time no one will know that it is you. It's rich--they all believe you to be dead."General Didenko was a tall bear of a Russian, with thick black hair, Brezhnev-like eyebrows, a broad Siberian forehead, and a swarthy complexion. He continued, "Paris, I should think, would be a good start. Then Rome, perhaps Bonn. Lisbon, then Brussels." The general smiled, but not in friendship. "But I will leave the exact details up to you. As and when you need information, your contact will be standing by in each city. Paris to begin with."They were walking along a beach east of the city, Didenko's bodyguards trailing out of earshot behind them. The breeze off the Mediterranean was cool but not unpleasant."Are you up to this assignment?" the general asked. Therewas a rumor that his position in Moscow was in serious trouble. If it was, however, the trouble was not reflected in his face or in his manner, which was confident."A diversion for what?" the man who was posing as McGarvey asked, his voice soft, even gentle."Are you capable of this?" the general demanded, ignoring the question for the moment.The imposter nodded. "Yes, I am capable, but first you will tell me what your real plans are, Comrade General. You are no Baranov.""No," Didenko said. "Nor are you his tool any longer. Now you belong to me." He smiled again and took the man's arm. "But come, Arkasha, and I will tell you everything you wish to know. Simply everything. Then you will see why I have picked you."The imposter stepped out of the stairwell, hurried across the corridor, and let himself into one of the offices, closing and locking the door behind him.CIA operations were, for the most part, conducted one floor above, where security, both electronic and physical, was tight. There would be Agency people in the corridor at the stairwell doors and elevator. Armed. In the early planning stages it had been a bothersome detail. It would do him no good to simply shoot his way onto the floor. Even if he successfully penetrated the station, he'd probably not get out of the building alive, and certainly not without being spotted and followed.Laying his coat and gloves on the desk in the tiny office, he took off his suit jacket and tie, putting them aside as well. Next he took his pistol, a Walther PPK, out of his shoulder holster, screwed the silencer tube on the end of the barrel, set it on the desk, and then took off the holster and began unbuttoning his shirt.The communications center was directly above this office. At this moment there would be at least a dozen technicians and operators up there, perhaps more, as well as a few million dollars' worth of sensitive communications and cryptographic equipment.On the far side of the building, but still one floor above, were the secure briefing rooms and the offices of Chief of Station Thomas Lord and Assistant Chief of Station Bob Graves. Both were highly capable men, absolutely vital to the Paris operation.Without them, CIA operations would suffer in all of Europe for a long time to come.Someone was at the door, trying the knob. The imposter snatched his pistol and switched the safety off as he stepped into the deep shadows in the corner. The only light in the room came from outside.Moments later a key grated in the lock, and the door opened. An old man, stoop-shouldered with a heavy paunch and white hair, came in and flipped on the light. He was alone.For a moment the old man didn't understand what he was seeing: the clothing on the desk, the man in the corner. But then he started to step back, his left hand coming up as if to ward off a blow, and the Russian shot him in the face, the bullet destroying his left eye, flinging him backward, half out into the corridor.No one was supposed to come down here. The man had had no business being on the second floor at this hour.The imposter rushed to the doorway and looked out into the corridor. No one was there. Apparently no one had heard a thing. No alarms were sounding.Hurriedly he dragged the man's body back into the office. Using his handkerchief, he wiped up the blood and cranial fluid that had leaked from the wound in case someone else came this way in the next minute or two.He closed and relocked the door, flipped off the light, and took a deep breath to ease the tension in his chest.It had been a stupid mistake, one that might well cost him the mission. Now someone would come looking for the man.

Two years later their adopted teenage daughter, Edith, an aspiring actress, will exploit every opportunity to escape the captivity her father has imposed on her.&nbsp; Time closes in on them all and as the new century approaches, the ranch stands untenanted. And then in March 1930, Elise Lester, a librarian from New York City, settles on San Miguel with her husband, Herbie, a World War I veteran full of manic energy.&nbsp; As the years go on they find a measure of fulfillment and serenity; Elise gives birth to two daughters, and the family even achieves a celebrity of sorts. But will the peace and beauty of the island see them through the impending war as it had seen them through the Depression?</p>Rendered in Boyle&#x2019;s accomplished, assured voice, with great period detail and utterly memorable characters, this is a moving and dramatic work from one of America&#x2019;s most talented and inventive storytellers.</p><p>T.

The immigrant experience is a constant in American life; although the tides ebb and flow, it seems that there always has been an immigrant presence in the United States. What's different today, of course, is where the immigrants are coming from: half are Latin American. <p> Gonzalez, a columnist for the New York <i>Daily News</i>, studies these latest arrivals in a book that combines history and journalism. He has a keen understanding of Hispanic diversity, focusing not just on "Hispanics" as a monolithic category but as a variety of people from many nations. The politics in <i>Harvest of Empire</i> are often tendentious: Gonzalez unfavorably compares U.S. border control efforts to building the Great Wall in China, demands an end to Puerto Rico's "colonial status," insists that Spanish become an official language actively encouraged in the public schools, and so on. His agenda will no doubt appeal to a certain kind of reader, but at the cost of alienating many others, including, probably, a majority of Hispanics living in the United States. For those looking for a left-leaning account of Hispanic immigration, however, this book succeeds as an ambitious survey. <i>--John J.

Each one identifies the earmarks of the type of cat in question, the facts and lore surrounding it and its many variations. Among the tidbits: "Asia" is a good name for a marmalade puss because that was the breed's original habitat; feline genetics decrees that almost all tortoiseshell and calico cats are female (the rare males are usually sterile); a tabby cat starred in the first X-rated cartoon, Fritz the Cat ; Cardinal Richelieu always signed death warrants with his black Angora, Ludovic the Cruel, sitting on his lap. There are also cat horoscopes, more wonderfully imaginative cat names, recipes for cat treats and a short course on cat communication, all enwrapped by King's photographs, which display an exquisite eye for the subtleties of face and fur. The only quibble--and it is mouse-sized--has to do with Taylor's practical advice: cat owners would do better to turn to books more detailed and less fanciful. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>84, Charing Cross Road (Chinese Edition)</h2><p>A dramatization of the American Helene Hanff&#39;s 20-year correspondence with a London antiquarian bookshop.

In this vibrant picture book, Isadora retells the Russian folktale that inspired the ballet <i>The Firebird</i>. Searching for a magic tree in a nearby forest, Ivan first captures, then releases the Firebird, who promises to help him in time of trouble. Trouble soon comes when a beautiful princess in the woods reveals that she and her companions are held prisoner by an evil sorcerer and his crew of demonic monsters. With the Firebird's help, Ivan kills the sorcerer, frees the captives, and marries the princess. Illustrating the simple text are impressionistic paintings that expressively interpret the story with vivid color, movement, and energy. The characters wear ballet shoes and costumes, and their movements reflect the illustrator's dance training, yet the double-page spreads seem to be arbitrary boundaries on our vision into a magical world rather than a tidy proscenium arch framing a stage production. An exciting entr{&#x201a;}ee to both the story and the ballet. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i>Former ballerina Isadora (Swan Lake; Lili at Ballet) brings her dance training to bear on this distinctive version of the classic Russian folktale; here, the Balanchine/Stravinsky ballet is the chief source of inspiration. Fantastical watercolors in midnight-hued purples, blues and greens spiked with red and gold conjure up dramatic, unusually dynamic scenes. Pictured as dancers, Prince Ivan, a band of beautiful princesses, a sorcerer with his hideous demon apprentices and, of course, the dazzling Firebird-"half woman, half bird, with feathers bright as flames"-pose, frolic, leap and soar across the pages. Unabashedly romantic, Isadora's stately book is a treat for balletomanes and the uninitiated alike.

He is a camping and canoe enthusiast, a frequent guest on radio and television and speaks at key canoe events. </p><p> <b>Margaret Howard</b> is a registered dietitian, and a food and nutrition consultant. She is the author of <i>The Complete Book of Small-Batch Preserving</i> and <i>All Fired Up: Outdoor and Indoor Grilling</i>. </p><p>Introduction</p> <p>I once went through a stage in my camping life during which I would simply throw bland meals like macaroni and cheese or those prepackaged freeze-dried meals together and head out into the woods to endure a night or two. It certainly didn't last long. I quickly got bored with roughing it out there, and I definitely got tired of eating bad meals.</p> <p>I devoted more time to trip planning and actually became obsessed with food. Each meal was nutritious and, more importantly, tasty. I bought myself a food dehydrator, which literally changed my life. I was able to go out for longer periods. I flourished out there and loved every minute of it.</p> <p>Getting meals ready for your camping trip can be overwhelming at times. There are the countless recipes to choose from, the ingredients to pick up, the taste testing to be done, food to dehydrate if you're heading to the interior or, if you're simply heading to the campground, the perfect cooler to purchase. Then you have to pack it all. It's not hard to fill a minivan, and people choosing to rough it in the wilderness have to stuff everything into packs strapped to their backs. It's a daunting task to say the least.</p> <p>But then you go on your trip and have the time of your life. Loons serenade in the evening, the kids swim at the beach all day and every meal you prepare works out even better than planned.</p> <p>The truth is, it's all worth it in the end. You just have to remind yourself of that while running around, packing and preparing everything. So make sure you have fun while preparing for the trip. Try a different recipe, add a secret ingredient, have the rest of the group get involved, organize a pre-trip dinner party -- whatever it takes. Remember, it will all be worth it when you get there, and sometimes preparing for a camping trip can be more fun than the actual trip itself.</p> <p>That's why when my publisher asked if I wanted to coauthor a gourmet camp cookbook, I jumped at the chance. Especially when he told me that the other writer would be Margaret Howard, a former dietitian, food and nutrition consultant and author of over 16 cookbooks. With Margaret making up the recipes and me writing up all the technical how-to jargon, it was a perfect match -- like Red Green and Julia Child.</p> <p> -- Kevin Callan</p> <br><p>I am not an interior camper, but I love writing cookbooks, and working with camping enthusiast Kevin Callan has been very special as he provided me with a great appreciation and knowledge for his beloved activity. His enthusiasm for camping has been quite infectious. </p> <p>When I say I am not a camper that is not quite true, as our family sailed for many years starting in a 16-foot dinghy before finally moving to a 24-foot sailboat. During those years, we lived on these boats over weekends as well as for longer periods of time as we sailed around Lake Ontario. Much like camping in many respects, the water supply was limited, the cooling methods were less than desirable, and after the ice melted, we resorted to the types of food that an interior camper does. During those years when we sailed in Canada and in the Caribbean our supply of fresh foods was limited by how much cooler storage capacity we had until we arrived at the next port. I recall how we always purchased an entire stalk of bananas (more than 50 on the stalk) and how many bananas we had to eat as they ripened.</p> <p>Our other family holidays in summer, which included four children and a large and hungry collie, were to a northern cottage. Here, again, the facilities were quite simple, meaning outhouses as well as cooking on a two-burner hot plate, and a wood stove used for warmth when needed, but which was the last thing we wanted to use for cooking on very hot summer days.</p> <p>My enthusiasm for cooking and for writing cookbooks has never diminished over the 30-plus years and 16 cookbooks I have had the privilege to write for both Canadian and U.S. consumers. From books for product promotion while in the corporate world, to those for healthy eating, to those for people with health concerns such as diabetes, and to fun-loving books on preserving as well as grilling, I have tested, tasted and tested again to ensure all recipes I have written will be fail-proof to the reader. And so to the camp chef, bon app�tit!</p> <p> -- Margaret Howard</p></p><h2>False Colours</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Reading Georgette Heyer is the next best thing to reading Jane Austen.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p></p><p><i>A missing twin</i></p><p></p><p>Something is very wrong, and the Honourable Christopher &#x201c;Kit&#x201d; Fancot can sense it.

She was legendary for her research, historical accuracy and extraordinary plots and characterizations.<p><b>One</b></p> <p>It was past two o'clock when the job-chaise turned into Hill Street; and, as the watchman wending his way round Berkeley Square monotonously announced, a fine night. A full moon rode in the cloudless sky, dimming the street-lamps: even, as the solitary traveller had noticed, in Pall Mall, where gas-lighting had replaced the oil-burners. Linkmen, carriages, and light streaming from an open door on the east side of Berkeley Square indicated that not all the members of the ton had left London; but at the end of June the Season was drawing to a close; and it did not surprise the traveller to find Hill Street deserted. It would not have surprised him if the knocker had been removed from the door of a certain house on the north side of the street, but when the chaise drew up a swift scrutiny reassured him: the Earl of Denville's town residence had not yet been abandoned for the summer months. The traveller, a young man, wearing a tasselled and corded Polish greatcoat, and a shallow-crowned beaver, sprang down from the chaise, dragged a bulging portmanteau from the floor of this vehicle, set it down on the flagway, and pulled out his purse. The postboys paid, he picked up the portmanteau, trod up the steps to the front-door, and gave the iron bell-pull a tug.</p> <p>By the time the last echo of the clapper died away the chaise had disappeared, but no one had responded to the bell's summons. The traveller gave it a second, and more vigorous, tug. He heard it clanging somewhere in the nether regions, but was forced to conclude, after waiting for several minutes, that it had failed to rouse any of my lord's servants.</p> <p>He considered the matter. It was possible, though unlikely, that the household had removed from London without taking the knocker from the door, or shuttering the windows. To verify that the windows had not been shuttered he retreated to the flagway, and scanned the house, perceiving that not only were all the windows unshuttered but that one of them, on the entrance-floor, had been left open a few inches at the top. This gave, as he knew, on to the dining-room; and to reach it presented a lithe and determined young man with no insuperable difficulty. Divesting himself of his greatcoat, and trusting that no watchman would come down the street in time to observe his clandestine entry, he proceeded to demonstrate to the uninterested moon that Colonel Dan Mackinnon, of the Coldstream Guards, was not without a rival in the art of perilous climbing.</p> <p>No such thought entered the Hon. Christopher Fancot's head: he was not acquainted with Colonel Mackinnon; and he did not think the feat of reaching the desired window-sill either dangerous or difficult. Once there it was easy to thrust up the lower sash, and to swing himself into the room. A couple of minutes later he emerged into the hall, where, upon a marble-topped side-table, he found a lamp burning low, with an unlit candle in a silver holder standing beside it. Observing these objects with an intelligent eye, Mr Fancot concluded that their noble owner had told his servants not to wait up for him. The subsequent discovery that the front-door was unbolted confirmed him in this belief. As he opened the door, to retrieve his belongings from the porch, he reflected, with an inward chuckle, that when his lordship did come home at last he would find his bed occupied by a most unlooked-for visitor, and would in all probability think that he was a great deal boskier than he had supposed.</p> <p>On this thought, which appeared, from the mischievous smile which played about the corners of his mouth, to afford Mr Fancot amusement, he kindled the candle at the lamp's low flame, and made his way towards the staircase.</p> <p>He went softly up, the candlestick held in one hand, his portmanteau in the other, and his greatcoat flung over his shoulder. No creaking stair betrayed him, but as he rounded the bend in the second flight a door opened on the floor above, and a voice said anxiously: &#x2018;Evelyn?'</p> <p>He looked up, seeing, in the light of a bedroom-candle held aloft in a fragile hand, a feminine form enveloped in a cloud of lace, which was caught together by ribbons of the palest green satin. From under a nightcap of charming design several ringlets the colour of ripe corn had been allowed to escape. The gentleman on the stairs said appreciatively: &#x2018;What a fetching cap, love!'</p> <p>The vision thus addressed heaved a sigh of relief, but said, with a gurgle of laughter: &#x2018;You absurd boy! Oh, Evelyn, I'm so thankful you've come, but what in the world has detained you? I've been sick with apprehension!'</p> <p>There was a quizzical gleam in the gentleman's eyes, but he said in accents of deep reproach: &#x2018;Come, come, Mama !'</p> <p>&#x2018;It may be very well for you to say Come, come, Mama,' she retorted, &#x2018;but when you faithfully promised to return not a day later than ' She broke off, staring down at him in sudden doubt.</p> <p>Abandoning the portmanteau, the gentleman shrugged the greatcoat from his shoulder, pulled off his hat, and mounted the remaining stairs two at a time, saying still more reproachfully: &#x2018;No, really, Mama! How can you be so unnatural a parent?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Kit!' uttered his unnatural parent, in a smothered shriek. &#x2018;Oh, my darling, my dearest son!'</p> <p>Mr Fancot, receiving his widowed mama on his bosom, caught her in a comprehensive hug, but said, on a note of laughter: &#x2018;Oh, what a rapper! I'm not your dearest son!'</p> <p>Standing on tiptoe to kiss his lean cheek, and dropping wax from her tilted candle down the sleeve of his coat, Lady Denville replied with dignity that she had never felt the smallest preference for either of her twin sons.</p> <p>&#x2018;Of course not! How should you, when you can't tell us apart?' said Mr Fancot, prudently removing the candlestick from her grasp.</p> <p>&#x2018;I can tell you apart!' she declared. &#x2018;If I had expected to see you I should have recognized you instantly! The thing was, I thought you were in Vienna.'</p> <p>&#x2018;No, I'm here,' said Mr Fancot, smiling lovingly down at her. &#x2018;Stewart gave me leave of absence: are you pleased?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, no, not a bit!' she said, tucking her hand in his arm, and drawing him into her bedchamber. &#x2018;Let me look at you, wicked one! Oh, I can't see you properly! Light all the candles, dearest, and then we may be comfortable. The money that is spent on candles in this house! I shouldn't have thought it possible if Dinting hadn't shown me the chandler's bill which, I must say, I wish she had not, for what, I ask you, Kit, is the use of knowing the cost of candles? One must have them, after all, and even your father never desired me to purchase tallow ones.'</p> <p>&#x2018;I suppose one might burn fewer,' remarked Kit, applying a taper to some half-dozen which stood in two chandeliers on the dressing-table.</p> <p>&#x2018;No, no, nothing more dismal than an ill-lit room! Light the ones on the mantelpiece, dearest! Yes, that is much better! Now come and tell me all about yourself!'</p> <p>She had drifted over to an elegant day-bed, and patted it invitingly, but Kit did not immediately obey the summons. He stood looking about him at the scene he had illumined, exclaiming: &#x2018;Why, how is this, Mama? You were used to live in a rose-garden, and now one would think oneself at the bottom of the sea!'</p> <p>As this was the impression she had hoped to create when, at stupendous cost, she had had the room redecorated in varying shades of green, she was pleased, and said approvingly: &#x2018;Exactly so! I can't think how I endured those commonplace roses for so long particularly when poor Mr Brummell told me years ago that I was one of the few females whom green becomes better than any other colour.'</p> <p>&#x2018;It does,' he agreed. His eyes alighted on the bed, and crinkled at the corners as he saw that the billowing curtains were of gauze. &#x2018;Very dashing! Improper, too.'</p> <p>An enchanting ripple of laughter broke from her. &#x2018;Fudge! Do you think the room pretty?'</p> <p>He came to sit beside her, raising her hands to his lips, and planting a kiss in its palm. &#x2018;Yes, like yourself: pretty and absurd!'</p> <p>&#x2018;And like you!' she retorted.</p> <p>He dropped her hand, not unnaturally revolted. &#x2018;Good God ! No, Mama!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, absurd, at all events,' she amended, thinking, however, that it would have been impossible to have found two more handsome men than her twin sons.</p> <p>The Polite World, to which they belonged, would have said, more temperately, that the Fancot twins were a good-looking pair, but by no means as handsome as had been their father. Neither had inherited the classical regularity of his features: they favoured their mother; and although she was an accredited Beauty dispassionate persons were agreed that her loveliness lay not so much in any perfection of countenance as in her vivacious charm. This, asserted her more elderly admirers, was comparable to the charm of the Fifth Duke of Devonshire's first wife. There were other points of resemblance between her and the Duchess: she adored her children, and she was recklessly extravagant.</p> <p>As for Kit Fancot, at four-and-twenty he was a well-built young man, slightly above the average height, with good shoulders, and an excellent leg for the prevailing fashion of skin-tight pantaloons. He was darker than his mother, his glossy locks showing more chestnut than gold; and there was a firmness about his mouth which hers lacked. But his eyes were very like hers: lively, their colour between blue and gray, and laughter rarely far from them. He had her endearing smile as well; and this, with his easy unaffected manners, made him a general favourite. He was as like his brother as fourpence to a groat, only those most intimately acquainted with them being able to tell them apart. What difference there was did not lie perceptibly in feature or in stature, unless they were stood side by side, when it could be seen that Kit was a shade taller than Evelyn, and that Evelyn's hair showed a trifle more burnished gold than Kit's. Only the very discerning could detect the real difference between them, for it was subtle, and one ...</p></p><h2>My Teacher</h2><p>A book about the celebration of the many ways teachers can inspire students</p><p></p><h2>Quintilian on the Teaching of Speaking and Writing: Translations from Books One, Two and Ten of the Institutio oratoria (Landmarks in Rhetoric and Public Address)</h2><p><p>Quintilian&#x2019;s method is based on the interrelationship between speaking, reading, and writing.

But how did this mythical bird become so famous that it has played a part in cultures around the world and throughout human history? How much of its story do we actually know? Here to offer a comprehensive biography and engaging (un)natural history of the phoenix is Joseph Nigg, esteemed expert on mythical creatures&#x2014;from griffins and dragons to sea monsters.<br><br> Beginning in ancient Egypt and traveling around the globe and through the centuries, Nigg&#x2019;s vast and sweeping narrative takes readers on a brilliant tour of the cross-cultural lore of this famous, yet little-known, immortal bird. Seeking both the similarities and the differences in the phoenix&#x2019;s many myths and representations, Nigg describes its countless permutations over millennia, including legends of the Chinese &#x201c;phoenix,&#x201d; which was considered one of the sacred creatures that presided over China&#x2019;s destiny; classical Greece and Rome, where it can be found in the writings of Herodotus and Ovid; nascent and medieval Christianity, in which it came to embody the resurrection; and in Europe during the Renaissance, when it was a popular emblem of royals. Nigg examines the various phoenix traditions, the beliefs and tales associated with them, their symbolic and metaphoric use, the skepticism and speculation they&#x2019;ve raised, and their appearance in religion, bestiaries, and even contemporary popular culture, in which the ageless bird of renewal is employed as a mascot and logo, including for our own University of Chicago.<br><br> Never bested by hardship or defeated by death, the phoenix is the ultimate icon of hope and rebirth. And in <i>The Phoenix: An Unnatural Biography of a Mythical Beast</i>, it finally has its due&#x2014;a complete chronicle worthy of such a fantastic and phantasmal creature. This entertaining and informative look at the<br> life and transformation of the phoenix will be the authoritative source for anyone fascinated by folklore and mythology, re-igniting our curiosity about one of myth&#x2019;s greatest beasts.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Since publication of <i>The Book of Gryphons</i> in 1982, <b>Joseph Nigg</b> has explored the rich cultural lives of mythical creatures in a variety of styles and formats for readers of all ages. His books have garnered multiple awards and have been translated into more than twenty languages. His most recent book, <i>Sea Monsters: A Voyage around the World&#x2019;s Most Beguiling Map</i>, was also published by the University of Chicago Press. He lives in Denver.<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;In this insightful cultural history of the mythical, self-immolating bird, Nigg traces the evolution of the phoenix from its origin as a sacred Egyptian symbol of the sun to its modern appearances in popular literature and as a motif in civic and corporate logos. Using excerpts from the writings of scholars, ecclesiastics, and poets&#x2014;as well as a selection of pictorial representations from ancient eras to the present day&#x2014;Nigg illustrates how the creature&#x2019;s association with rebirth and longevity has resonated throughout history, serving variously as a symbol of resurrection to Christians, an alchemical allegory for the process of chemical and spiritual transformation, and a poetic convention for an idealized lover or the hopeless passion of the lovelorn. The enduring power of the phoenix as an emblem of triumph over adversity even led to its adoption as a symbol for rebuilding efforts following the September 11 terrorist attacks.

The first chapter is an overview and &#34;route map&#34; and is followed by an exposition of irreversibility, the expansion of the universe and other arrows of time. The author examines the thesis that the thermodynamic arrow follows the cosmological one, and in doing so extends traditional statistical mechanics. The second part of the book presents a new theory of quantum measurement and possible experimental tests. This theory incorporates the extended statistical mechanics in an essential way. The last chapter discusses open experimental and theoretical issues. Written in a lively and accessible style, the text is liberally sprinkled with exercises. Each chapter ends with a resources section that includes notes, further reading, and technical appendices.

The mistake takes the shape of Anne Shirley, a redheaded 11-year-old girl who can talk anyone under the table. Fortunately, her sunny nature and quirky imagination quickly win over her reluctant foster parents. Anne's feisty spirit soon draws many friends--and much trouble--her way. Not a day goes by without some melodramatic new episode in the tragicomedy of her life. Early on, Anne declares her eternal antipathy for Gilbert Blythe, a classmate who commits the ultimate sin of mocking her hair color. Later, she accidentally dyes that same cursed hair green. Another time, in her haste to impress a new neighbor, she bakes a cake with liniment instead of vanilla. Lucy Maud Montgomery's series of books about Anne have remained classics since the early 20th century. Her portrayal of this feminine yet independent spirit has given generations of girls a strong female role model, while offering a taste of another, milder time in history.

This stupendous evolution was far from a foregone conclusion at independence. The conquest of the North American continent required violence, suffering, and bloodshed. It also required the creation of a national government strong enough to go to war against, and acquire territory from, its North American rivals.<br><br> In&nbsp;<i>A Hercules in the Cradle</i>, Max M. Edling argues that the federal government&#x2019;s abilities to tax and to borrow money, developed in the early years of the republic, were critical to the young nation&#x2019;s ability to wage war and expand its territory. He traces the growth of this capacity from the time of the founding to the aftermath of the Civil War, including the funding of the War of 1812 and the Mexican War. Edling maintains that the Founding Fathers clearly understood the connection between public finance and power: a well-managed public debt was a key part of every modern state. Creating a debt would always be a delicate and contentious matter in the American context, however, and statesmen of all persuasions tried to pay down the national debt in times of peace.&nbsp;<i>A Hercules in the Cradle</i>&nbsp;explores the origin and evolution of American public finance and shows how the nation&#x2019;s rise to great-power status in the nineteenth century rested on its ability to go into debt.</p><p><b>Max M. Edling</b>&nbsp;is a lecturer in North American history at King&#x2019;s College London and is the author of&nbsp;<i>A Revolution in Favor of Government: Origins of the U.S. Constitution and the Making of the American State</i>.&#x201c;I consider Edling one of the finest historians of the early American republic in the world today. <i>A Hercules in the Cradle</i> will revolutionize the way historians think about the founding and development of the federal state&#x2015;a state with the capacity to fulfill the expanding new empire's &#x2018;manifest destiny.&#x2019;&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> (Peter S. Onuf, Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation)<br><br>&#x201c;Edling&#x2019;s <i>Hercules in the Cradle</i> shows how vitally important fiscal policy has been in laying the groundwork for the modern state. Revisionist historians have long challenged the Cold War shibboleth that the national government in the early republic was nothing but a &#x2018;midget institution in a giant land.&#x2019; Edling&#x2019;s distinctive contribution is to bring this revisionist sensibility to the study of public finance. This lucid and informative monograph vaults Edling to the front ranks of historians of state and society in the nineteenth-century United States; it should remain a standard work in the field for many years to come.&#x201d; (Richard R. John <i>Columbia University</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Max Edling deploys his unrivaled mastery of fiscal policy to trace the transformation of the United States in less than a century from a loose confederation into a world power.&nbsp; He conclusively shows that the ability of American politicians to finance warfare and territorial expansion, despite widespread fear of the national government and long-term debt, was a major reason why the United States succeeded where other nations faltered.&#x201d; (Andrew Cayton, coauthor of The Dominion of War: Empire and Liberty in North America, 1500-2000)<br><br>&#x201c;In his first book, Max Edling virtually forced American historians to rethink the first premises underlying the adoption of the Constitution. The Federalists of 1787-1788, he demonstrated, were true state-builders. In his new book, Edling traces what that state looked like, how it evolved, and how, notwithstanding all the constitutional controversies it provoked, it proved to be a far more effective vehicle for mobilizing national resources for war than most scholars have appreciated. Thanks to Edling, we now have a much more sophisticated basis for comparing the development of the American state after 1789 to its European counterparts.&#x201d; (Jack Rakove, author of Original Meanings: Politics and Ideas in the Making of the Constitution)<br><br>&#x201c;Edling examines in detail the financing of three wars: the War of 1812, the Mexican War, and the Civil War.&nbsp;. . . Exploring the origins and evolution of American public finance, this book&nbsp;is well written and clearly argued. Highly recommended.&#x201d; (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br><p>&#x201c;In this book, following themes laid out in his first monograph, Edling enhances his reputation as one of the leading historians of early US state formation. . . . <i>A Hercules in the Cradle</i> makes a convincing argument for the success of government finance as a crucial source of US expansion and power.&#x201d;</p> (<i>H-Net Reviews</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Edling has written a very important book, one that deserves to be widely read by both academic specialists and persons interested in the foundations of American power in the twentieth century. . . . <i>Hercules in the Cradle </i>is a well-argued and meticulously researched contribution to an emerging historiography on the development of the early American state.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>New England Quarterly</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In this lively study, bristling with fresh insights and enhanced by serious quantitative analyses, Edling makes a compelling case for America&#x2019;s growing out of its Herculean cradle because successive administrations successfully addressed its fiscal needs.&#x201d; (<i>Joyce Appleby, American Political Thought</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Edling&#x2019;s account of how the development of an American fiscal-military state made possible the US government&#x2019;s &#x2018;liberal use of . . . aggression and violence&#x2019; to achieve its policy aims during the nineteenth century will provide scholars with valuable, interlinked case studies to consult for many years to come. Edling clearly deserves to be numbered among the most original and influential foreign scholars writing American history today.&#x201d; (<i>Journal of the Civil War Era</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Edling shows how American leaders even outdid Europeans in their embrace of borrow-now, tax-later policies. This sheds new light on war financing beyond what we have long known about the individual conflicts by providing an overarching framework for understanding how this model developed and for appreciating its persistence over time, even in the face of considerable social, economic, and political change. In an era when an estimated four-fifths of all federal spending was on war or preparation for war, Edling tells us an important story about the antebellum state.&#x201d; (<i>Journal of the Early Republic</i>)</p><h2>Tuttle Concise Japanese Dictionary: Japanese-English English-Japanese</h2><p><b>Every serious student of Japanese needs a reliable and user&#x2013;friendly dictionary in their collection.</b><br><br><i>Tuttle Concise Japanese Dictionary</i>, now with 30% more content, is a thoroughly updated dictionary designed for students and business people who are living in Japan and using the Japanese language on a daily basis.

Or is it actually much more than that-the use of rules about meter, form, and rhyme to create a framework for the expression of special observations and ideas?</p><p><em>POEM-MAKING</em> is a handbook of the mechanics of writing poetry. In a clear, understandable tone it introduces children to the different voices of poetry; types of rhyme and other elements of sound, rhythm, and metrics; and some of the most common forms of poetry.</p><p>Myra Cohn Livingston is a well known author, anthologist, poet, and teacher. She has used all her experiences in these fields to make <em>POEM MAKING</em> a useful, accessible, and unique guide for children to use in creating poems of their own.</p></p><p>Myra Cohn Livingston has over 50 books to her credit, including (with Norma Faber) These Small Things, a 1987 ALA Notable Book a Booklist Editors&#x2019; Choice, and a CCBC Choice. She has twice won the Texas Institute of Letters award, and she received the 1980 NCTE Award for Excellence in Poetry. <p></p>Grade 4-9-- This well-known poet, anthologist, and teacher demonstrates what makes a poem a poem in a concise, simple, readable manner. She explains the various voices of poetry; types of rhyme; and other elements of sound, rhythm, and metrics. She also discusses figures of speech such as simile, metaphor, and personification; and the forms of haiku, cinquain, limerick, free verse, and concrete poetry. The book is organized well, each chapter building successfully on the previous one. The examples throughout draw from the works of many familiar poets, and effectively illustrate Livingston's points. However, there are no explanations for the notations used to diagram meter; for some they may be obvious in context, but perhaps not for all. The author treats mechanics and style with much more detail than X. J. Kennedy's Knock at a Star (Little, 1985), which, while it supplies excellent and profuse examples and is extremely readable, only touches on the surface, especially where it concerns meter. While this book is an excellent introduction to the serious craftsmanship of poetry for beginners, it ends rather abruptly and, because its approach is more academic than in other books, it is likely that few children will pick it up on their own. It will certainly be useful for teachers, easily refreshing their memories of the basics and giving them a guideline to follow in teaching poetry. --Annette Curtis Klause, Montgomery County Department of Public Libraries, MD<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Conversion of Scandinavia: Vikings, Merchants, and Missionaries in the Remaking of Northern Europe</h2><p><p>In this book a MacArthur Award-winning scholar argues for a radically new interpretation of the conversion of Scandinavia from paganism to Christianity in the early Middle Ages. Overturning the received narrative of Europe's military and religious conquest and colonization of the region, Anders Winroth contends that rather than acting as passive recipients, Scandinavians converted to Christianity because it was in individual chieftains' political, economic, and cultural interests to do so. </p><p>Through a painstaking analysis and historical reconstruction of both archeological and literary sources, and drawing on scholarly work that has been unavailable in English, Winroth opens up new avenues for studying European ascendency and the expansion of Christianity in the medieval period.</p></p><p><b>Anders Winroth</b>, the Forst Family Professor of History at Yale, is the author of <i>The Making of Gratian's "Decretum," </i>for which he was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 2003.&#34;&#39;Challenging the stereotypical master narrative of zealous evangelicals and active missionaries converting an at best passive, at worst resistant, native heathen population, Winroth is able to substitute a fascinating description of the distinctive political dynamics that characterised all of Western Europe after the barbarian invasions&#39; (Patrick Madigan, Heythrop Journal) &#39;He is well acquainted with the comprehensive and varied research and guides the reader to synthesizing conclusions and wider perspectives...

But when the war for independence sparked in 1776, colonists united under the banner of religious freedom. Evangelical frontiersmen and Deist intellectuals set aside their differences to defend a belief they shared, the right to worship freely. Inspiring an unlikely but powerful alliance, it was the idea of religious liberty that brought the colonists together in the battle against British tyranny.<p>In <i>God of Liberty</i>, historian Thomas S. Kidd argues that the improbable partnership of evangelicals and Deists saw America through the Revolutionary War, the ratification of the Constitution, and the election of Thomas Jefferson in 1800. A thought-provoking reminder of the crucial role religion played in the Revolutionary era, <i>God of Liberty</i> represents both a timely appeal for spiritual diversity and a groundbreaking excavation of how faith powered the American Revolution.</p></p><p><b>Thomas S.

The Revolutionary and Constitutional periods were neither &#x2018;Christian&#x2019; nor &#x2018;godless&#x2019; as these terms are used in modern polemics.&nbsp;Instead, patriots and leaders of the early United States united to support disestablishment and common principles about the need for virtue to insure republican freedoms, despite holding different personal beliefs.&nbsp;Thomas Kidd is a remarkably sure-footed guide through this treacherous historical terrain.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<b>Harry S.

McClay, SunTrust Chair of Excellence in Humanities, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga</b>&#x201c;With this lively, crisply written, broadly researched, and unfailingly thoughtful study, Thomas Kidd illuminates the central importance of the religious ideas and sentiments undergirding the American Revolution and the early nation. Kidd explains why Americans, despite their remarkable religious and philosophical diversity, were able to unite effectively around broadly shared tenets of &#x2018;civil spirituality,&#x2019; which included a shared commitment to the sacred ideals of religious liberty&#x2014;tenets and ideals that still profoundly inform and influence the conduct of American life today.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br><b><i>Christian Century</i></b><i><br></i>&#x201c;With impressive command of the primary sources and deft historical analysis, Kidd has produced an indispensable survey of religious life during the Revolutionary era... all the more remarkable for its breadth...&nbsp; One of the many virtues of this book is that Kidd is a careful and judicious historian... he points out&#x2014;correctly&#x2014;the errors of both present-day secularists on the left, who insist that the founders barred religious voices from political discourse, and the church-state separation deniers on the right. &nbsp;The lesson of American history is that although church and state are institutionally separate, morality and freedom are seldom at odds and that, in fact, they are mutually reinforcing.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>Washington</i><i>&nbsp;Times</i></b><b><i>Choice</i></b> &#x201c;Kidd delineates a religious consensus that emerged to propel the American revolt and shape the resulting republic...a well-substantiated treatment.&#x201d;&#x201c;Thought-provoking, meticulously researched... a salutary reminder of the role religious belief played in the founding of our country.

In remarkable and insightful ways, Mark Taylor traces an entirely new way to view the evolution of our culture, detailing how information theory and the scientific concept of complexity can be used to understand recent developments in the arts and humanities. This book will ultimately be seen as a classic."-John L. Casti, Santa Fe Institute, author of <i>G�del: A Life of Logic, the Mind, and Mathematics</i><br><br>The science of complexity accounts for that inscrutable mix of chaos and order that governs our natural world. Complexity explains how networks emerge and function, how species organize into ecosystems, how stars form into galaxies, and how just a few sequences of DNA can account for so many different life forms. Recently, the idea of complexity has taken the worlds of business and politics by storm. The concept is used to account for phenomena as varied as the behavior of the stock market, the response of voting populations, and the effects of risk management. Even Disney has used complexity theory to manage crowd control at its theme parks.<br><br>Given the startling development of new information technologies, we now live in a moment of unprecedented complexity, an era in which change occurs faster than our ability to comprehend it. With <i>The Moment of Complexity</i>, Mark C. Taylor offers a timely map for this unfamiliar terrain opening in our midst, unfolding an original philosophy through a remarkable synthesis of science and culture. According to Taylor, complexity is not just a breakthrough scientific concept, but the defining quality of the post-Cold War era. The flux of digital currents swirling around us, he argues, has created a new network culture with its own distinctive logic and dynamic.<br><br>Drawing on resources from information theory and evolutionary biology, Taylor explains the operation of complex adaptive systems in social and cultural processes and captures a whole new zeitgeist in the making. To appreciate the significance of our emerging network culture, he claims, we need not only to understand contemporary scientific and technological transformations, but also to explore the subtle influences of art, architecture, philosophy, religion, and higher education. <i>The Moment of Complexity</i>, then, is a remarkable work of cultural analysis on a scale rarely seen today.

Written by an expert in the field of law enforcement, this book covers the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of approaches including crime-specific, community-oriented, problem-oriented, hot spot targeting, concentrated patrol deployment, broken windows enforcement, and intelligence-guided. Opening chapters trace the accumulating evidence for the substantial impact upon crime that focused police efforts can have. Community and problem-oriented programs are reviewed in the context of their employment for crime reduction. State-of-the-art strategies are organized by three targeting foci: geographic, offense, and offender. The role of investigative units in proactive crime reduction is critically assessed and Compstat as a framework receives special attention. Also discussed are crime strategy meetings, and staffing and deployment for crime control. Care is taken to review both the successes and failures of structured efforts both in suburban environments and major cities so that readers are provided with an unbiased overview of policing in the real world.</p><p>Larry T.

From jazz standards such as &#x201c;Mood Indigo&#x201d; and &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t Get Around Much Anymore,&#x201d; to his longer, more orchestral suites, to his leadership of the stellar big band he toured and performed with for decades after most big bands folded, Ellington represented a singular, pathbreaking force in music over the course of a half-century. At the same time, as one of the most prominent black public figures in history, Ellington demonstrated leadership on questions of civil rights, equality, and America&#x2019;s role in the world.<br><br>With <i>Duke Ellington&#x2019;s America</i>, Harvey G. Cohen paints a vivid picture of Ellington&#x2019;s life and times, taking him from his youth in the black middle class enclave of Washington, D.C., to the heights of worldwide acclaim. Mining extensive archives, many never before available, plus new interviews with Ellington&#x2019;s friends, family, band members, and business associates, Cohen illuminates his constantly evolving approach to composition, performance, and the music business&#x2014;as well as issues of race, equality and religion. Ellington&#x2019;s own voice, meanwhile, animates the book throughout, giving <i>Duke Ellington&#x2019;s America</i> an intimacy and immediacy unmatched by any previous account.<br><br>By far the most thorough and nuanced portrait yet of this towering figure, <i>Duke Ellington&#x2019;s America</i> highlights Ellington&#x2019;s importance as a figure in American history as well as in American music.</p></p><p><p></p>&nbsp;<b>Harvey G.

It offers sensitive coverage of all of Ellington&#x2019;s albums and major compositions, particularly after 1960, while virtually every other book on Ellington skirts over or neglects certain productions. Unlike almost all his predecessors, Cohen has produced a book that does justice to the complexity and importance of Duke Ellington&#x2019;s life.&#x201d;</p> (Burton Peretti, author of Lift Every Voice: The History of African American Music)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Cohen adds to the dozens of books about jazz great Duke Ellington with a new approach.. . . Cohen delivers a social history that firmly places the bandleader within his time. The author first describes the racial mores of Washington, DC, at the turn of the last century that shaped the young Ellington and attributes Ellington&#x2019;s success during the 1930s to the marketing campaign of manager Irving Mills, who branded him as a suave, elegant genius who could appeal to black and white audiences. Cohen covers Ellington&#x2019;s postwar challenges, his return to fame, his State Department tours, the &#x2018;sacred concerts,&#x2019; and his death in May 1974. Along the way, he focuses on changes in the record industry and music technology and the progress in civil rights. . . . Cohen offers a fascinating, exhaustively researched social history of Duke Ellington&#x2019;s world. Highly recommended for general readers and jazz aficionados alike.&#x201d;</p> (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Cohen&#x2019;s volume. . . . is substantial, richly sourced, intelligent, and, in many ways, persuasive.

Cohen&#x2019;s new book illuminates Ellington&#x2019;s career as never before, and also helps to deepen our understanding of larger trends and issues in American politics and culture. No previous book on Ellington has followed the money so rigorously, laying bare the interworkings of art and capital. Neither biography nor musical analysis, Duke Ellington&#x2019;s America is a social history of Ellington&#x2019;s career, a double portrait of musician and society that situates the music within three large issues: the struggle for African American civil rights, the growth of the popular music industry, and the emergence of the United States as a global power whose most effective cultural weapon was African American music. If Cohen has an overarching thesis, it may be that Ellington&#x2019;s personality and talents uniquely thrived in all three of these areas, despite the constant threats of appropriation, exploitation and even physical violence that hobbled or curtailed the careers of many of his contemporaries. Although Cohen&#x2019;s historical approach is not theory-driven, he skillfully lays out the cultural contradictions of Ellington&#x2019;s America in the ongoing clash between the tenacious structures of racism and the rapidly evolving music business, a paper empire erected on parallel pillars of copyright and organized crime. . . . Many older books about Ellington portrayed his later career as a decline and fall from the glories of the Ben Webster/Jimmie Blanton band of 1940 and 1941, and missed the story, which Cohen tells very well, of a rejuvenated creativity equal to Stravinsky&#x2019;s or Picasso&#x2019;s.&#x201d;</p> (David Schiff <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br><p>&#x201c;The idea of a substantial book about a major musical figure that pays relatively little attention to his music might seem counterintuitive &#x2014; or, to put it less politely, pointless.

D. degree in Mathematics. Its purpose was to determine whether first-year students in the Ph. D. program had successfully mastered basic mathematics in order to continue in the program with the likelihood of success. Since its inception, the exam has become a major hurdle to overcome in the pursuit of the degree. The purpose of this book is to publicize the material and aid in the preparation for the examination during the undergraduate years since a) students are already deeply involved with the material and b) they will be prepared to take the exam within the first month of the graduate program rather than in the middle or end of the first year. The book is a compilation of approximately nine hundred problems which have appeared on the preliminary exams in Berkeley over the last twenty years. It is an invaluable source of problems and solutions for every mathematics student who plans to enter a Ph. D. program. Students who work through this book will develop problem solving skills in areas such as real analysis, multi-variable calculus, differential equations, metric spaces, complex analysis, algebra, and linear algebra. The problems are organized by subject and ordered in an increasing level of difficulty. Tags with the exact exam year provide the opportunity to rehearse complete examinations. The appendix includes instructions on accessing electronic versions of the exams as well as a syllabus, statistics of passing scores, and a Bibliography used throughout the solutions.

This book traces the creative dialogue between France and Japan in the early twentieth century, focusing on Surrealist and avant-garde writings. It opens a theoretical treatment of cultural memory, influence, visuality, writing, nostalgia, and nation to suggest a new perspective for the reading of modern Japanese culture and cross-cultural interactions. The author argues that the problem of literary influences should be recast as a problem of cultural memory, where analysis of causes and effects gives way to a deeper analysis of displacements and aftershocks, which she calls cultural &#x201c;fault lines.&#x201d; The book analyzes the writings of Takiguchi Shuzo, Nishiwaki Junzaburo, Kitasono Katsue, and others whose work was associated explicitly with the Surrealist movement in Japan. It also incorporates readings of other experimental works and postwar performances that reflect the wider impact of these avant-garde ideas. The author argues that a vision of alterity, a foreign space located somewhere beyond, plays a crucial role in formulations of avant-garde praxis in both the Japanese and French contexts. Here exploration of Japanese notions of the Surreal, calling for a rereading of received notions about French avant-gardes, leads to a reconfiguration of this period, written less as a narrative history of literature than as the nonlinear route of a multivalent dialogue. Japanese Surrealism is important both for the specific questions it raises and for its exemplary place as an encounter between cultures, literary movements, and languages. As a movement that challenges and breaks apart clear and bounded conceptions of language, poetry, and the transmissibility of meaning, Japanese Surrealism reframes the relation between content and consciousness and is thus a particularly strong and revealing case of cultural interaction. What this avant-garde encounter makes apparent is that inherent discontinuities and fragmentations within individual cultures can also become crucial opportunities for productive intersections between distant realities and distant cultures.</p><p>&#x201c;Miryam Sas&#x2019;s Fault Lines is an important contribution to an area of Japanese studies that has been largely neglected, the Japanese avant-garde. . . .

Although women surf the Web in equal numbers to men and make a majority of online purchases, few are involved in the design and creation of new technology. It is mostly men whose perspectives and priorities inform the development of computing innovations and who reap the lion's share of the financial rewards. As only a small fraction of high school and college computer science students are female, the field is likely to remain a "male clubhouse," absent major changes.</p><p>In <i>Unlocking the Clubhouse</i>, social scientist Jane Margolis and computer scientist and educator Allan Fisher examine the many influences contributing to the gender gap in computing. The book is based on interviews with more than 100 computer science students of both sexes from Carnegie Mellon University, a major center of computer science research, over a period of four years, as well as classroom observations and conversations with hundreds of college and high school faculty. The interviews capture the dynamic details of the female computing experience, from the family computer kept in a brother's bedroom to women's feelings of alienation in college computing classes. The authors investigate the familial, educational, and institutional origins of the computing gender gap. They also describe educational reforms that have made a dramatic difference at Carnegie Mellon&#x2015;where the percentage of women entering the School of Computer Science rose from 7% in 1995 to 42% in 2000&#x2015;and at high schools around the country.</p></p><p>When there were no opportunities for women in the sciences, it was assumed they had no aptitude for the work. Even today, our tendency is to explain the gender gap by pointing out cognitive differences between men and women, overlooking the powerful societal pressures that guide young people into--and away from--certain careers. Convinced that "women must know more than how to <i>use</i> technology; they must know how to design and create it," Jane Margolis, a social scientist, and Allan Fisher, a computer scientist and college dean, devised a four-year study (involving some 230 interviews) at Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science. They found that the seven percent of female undergraduates at the college started out with as much excitement and talent as their male counterparts, but often wilted early on, perceiving that male students had come to college far better prepared than they had. "The study of computer science education can be seen as a microcosm of how a realm of power can be claimed by one group of people," the authors argue, "relegating others to outsiders." Happily, thanks to their efforts, female enrollment is up at Carnegie Mellon, and more women are remaining in the field. The racial divide in computer science is as pronounced as the gender gap, however, and would benefit from studies like the one described in <i>Unlocking the Clubhouse</i>. Surely the door can be pried open for blacks and Hispanics as well. <i>--Regina Marler</i>Jane Margolis is a Senior Researcher at the UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies and the coauthor of <i>Unlocking the Clubhouse: Women in Computing</i> (MIT Press).

Later in the century, the settlement became a flourishing French village filled with rows of low one-story French-style houses lining the streets. But the unique native and French bonds began when the explorers Louis Joliet and Pierre Marquette discovered a peaceful tribe, the Kaskaskia, while journeying along the Illinois River.&nbsp;</p><p>This historic friendship grew into a unique colonial culture, the remnants which can be seen through numerous primary source documents. Belting draws on and translates from eighteenth century French the Kaskaskia Manuscripts, in which French notaries recorded parish marriage contracts, property transactions (including slave sales), and estate inventories. She also examines the papers of the Marquis de Vaudreuil, among them the most complete census ever conducted in French Illinois, which provides a household-by-household enumeration of the population.

His compelling rhythms combine epic and lyric tones, public and most intimate themes, grief and joy. This bilingual volume of selected works is the first of its kind in any language, representing the remarkable range of an extraordinary poet. Zurita&#x2019;s work confronts the cataclysm of the Pinochet coup with a powerful urgency matched by remarkable craftsmanship and imaginative vision. In Zurita&#x2019;s attempt to address the atrocities that indelibly mark Chile, he makes manifest the common history of the Americas. </p><p></p></p><p><b>RA�L ZURITA</b>, a prolific poet and visual artist, has chronicled the violence against the Chilean people since the 1973 coup that replaced Salvador Allende&#x2019;s democratic government with Augusto Pinochet&#x2019;s military dictatorship. His work has been widely translated. Along with other artists, he founded the art action group CADA (Colectivo de Acciones de Arte), dedicated to the creation of political art resisting the military regime. In 1982 he composed a poem in the sky over New York, and in 1993 he bulldozed "<i>ni pena ni miedo</i>" ("no pain no fear") into the coarse sands of the Atacama Desert. Zurita has been awarded the Chilean National Prize for Literature and a scholarship from the Guggenheim Foundation. He is a professor emeritus at the Universidad Diego Portales in Santiago. <b></b><p><b>ANNA DEENY MORALES </b>is a literary critic and translator. Her translations of Ra�l Zurita&#x2019;s works include <i>Purgatory </i>and <i>Dreams for Kurosawa</i>. Her translation of <i>Floating Lanterns </i>by Mercedes Roff� was published in 2015, and her essays and translations of poetry by Alejandra Pizarnik, Nicanor Parra, and Gabriela Mistral, among others, have appeared in such anthologies as <i>Pinholes in the Night: Essential Poems from Latin America </i>and in journals, including the <i>Paris Review</i>, <i>Mandorla</i>, <i>BOMB</i>, and the <i>Harvard Review. </i>She teaches in the Center for Latin American Studies at Georgetown University.</p><p></p>"His poems are bone, river, spirit. They are weaved in the sky and in the desert. His words give us eyes to see the blue, the white, the endless hues of beige and ocher&#x2014;the colors of the desert he returns to. . .

Mythical and mesmerizing." &#x2014;<b><i>Prairie Schooner </i></b><br><br>&#x201c;There isn&#x2019;t a more important contemporary writer than Ra�l Zurita. And through her insistent attention&nbsp;to diction and syntax, Anna Deeny&nbsp;creates an English poetry as abrupt, heuristic, sweeping, and finally redemptive as the Spanish; to wit, she delivers Zurita&#x2019;s genius.&#x201d; &nbsp;&#x2014;Forrest Gander, author of&nbsp;<i>Eye Against Eye</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Torn Awake</i><br> "Ra�l&nbsp;Zurita is one of the essential poets of the twenty-first century, and we are fortunate to have these fiercely beautiful translations."&nbsp;&#x2014;Robert Hass, author of&nbsp;<i>The Apple Trees</i><i>at Olema&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>What Light Can Do</i><br><br>"In her powerful and useful introduction to these poems, Anna Morales reminds us of the specific historical events that generated Zurita's poetry. These need to be known. &#x2018;To be disappeared&#x2019; is to be taken away to another piece of the earth, a particular place, and hidden there. In Chile&nbsp;Pinochet and a population gone blood-mad did this. 'To disappear' is to die into God. &nbsp;Zurita studies this difference. &nbsp;His marvelous poetry, as such, is a work of mystery.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Fanny Howe, author of&nbsp;<i>Come and See</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Second Childhood</i></p><h2>Theorizing About Intercultural Communication</h2><p>In Theorizing About Intercultural Communication, editor William B.

It acknowledges dramatic industry changes with the integration of computers into virtually every step of the apparel manufacturing process, and introduces readers to the functions and skills needed to utilize this highly versatile and efficient tool. Narrative sections and illustrations cover the topics of basic patterns, bodices, skirts, pants, collars, sleeves, and pockets. Additional chapters on sportswear, functional finishes, and draping, supply even more explanation on simplified methods currently employed in the industry. For anyone preparing for a career, or interested in learning the latest techniques, in the fashion industry.</p><p>This second edition is a significantly expanded and revised version of the book that has been the basic instructional text for draping in numerous fashion design programs since its original publication. The book covers all of the fundamental material for the first year of study in an intensive fashion design program, plus the new edition has been expanded to include many of the more complex draping techniques covered in more advanced courses.<p> In preparation for this new edition of <i>Draping for Fashion Design,</i> we consulted with current users of the text and identified areas where revisions or new information would be helpful. As a result, we have made some changes and added new material throughout the book. </p> <p> The book now has a new introduction to provide some background about the work of fashion designers and the fashion industry. A brief discussion of the Apparel Company and its divisions is followed by a description of the various customers who buy apparel. We introduce the attributes of seasonal collections, suggest sources of inspiration, and describe the process that leads from the designer's idea to the prototype for production. </p> <p> Draping, as the course is currently taught in various design schools and universities, includes instruction in sewing when students carry draping projects to completion into finished garments. Since the course curriculum integrates sewing with draping, we have added "sewing tips" for many of the draping projects. Clear and simple sewing instructions are now integrated with draping into one textbook for a comprehensive draping course. We wish to emphasize, however, that no attempt has been made to make this a sewing book. The "sewing tips," which have been interspersed throughout, wherever they might be useful, merely address special sewing problems as they arise in a draping class. </p> <p> We have added a section that gives instructions for draping "The Bias Slip Dress" in "The Shift" chapter, and we have added a section on "Swimsuits" to the "Sportswear and Casual Wear" chapter. Also, in order to enhance clarity, we have revised diagrams and added new illustrations. </p> <p> Although computers are used as design and communication tools throughout the industry, we believe that designers still need a basic background of draping in fabric. By draping, the design student acquires the sense of proportion, which can only be developed by seeing the design take shape on the human figure. A feel for texture and the drapability of fabric can only be acquired by actually handling the fabric. Computers are, indeed, used to sketch and draft patterns for new designs, but to do this well requires the ability to correctly visualize the proportions of the finished garment. This skill is developed only by experience with full-size three-dimensional models. </p> <p> We gratefully acknowledge the support and help that we have received from our colleagues at the Fashion Institute of Technology (F.I.T.). The techniques used in this book have been developed over the course of many years of teaching and experimentation by the Fashion Design faculty at F I.T Refinements in precision were developed as various methods were tested at faculty workshops and in the classroom. Both students and teachers contributed to this process and it is impossible for us to mention everyone who participated over the years. There are, however, some people who were particularly instrumental in the development of the draping curriculum at F I.T Most noteworthy are Professor Emeritus Ernestine Kopp, the first chairperson of the Fashion Design Department, and Professor Emeritus Vittorina Rolfo, who for many years was the assistant chairperson and in that capacity was responsible for the development of new teachers in the department. Her expert guidance in the organization and presentation of the material is remembered gratefully by both of us. </p> <p> We are also deeply indebted to the many faculty members from numerous colleges and universities who, in response to our inquiry, thoughtfully pointed out areas where <i>Draping for Fashion Design</i> might be made more useful. The information they shared was invaluable. We carefully considered all responses and, wherever possible, followed their suggestions. We especially want to thank <i>Professor Sally I. Helvenston</i> of Michigan State University for pointing out the difficulties encountered when beginners attempted to drape the Peter Pan collar. In response, we included a simpler method combining draping with patternmaking. <i>Professor Sharon Bell</i> of the Academy of Art College, San Francisco, and <i>Professor Anne J. Smock</i> of the Philadelphia College of Textiles and Science, as well as several others, suggested a larger format and more illustrations for additional clarity. </p> <p> This would have been an impossible task without the unstintingly generous help from currently working designers and other industry professionals. They gave us the opportunity to observe firsthand today's methods of fashion design and pattern development. They shared with us the benefits of years of professional experience, gave us access to their sample rooms, and finally, reviewed our material after it was completed. </p> <p> Many thanks go to <i>Mary Ann Ferro,</i> designer for Woolrich Industries and adjunct assistant professor at F I.T., for sharing with us her method of developing the unstructured drop shoulder jacket. <i>Anthony J. Nuzzo,</i> senior director at Victoria's Secret Stores and adjunct assistant professor at FI.T, worked with us on techniques of draping basic patterns in knitted fabrics and the new section on swimsuits. <i>Lisa Donofrio,</i> freelance designer and instructor at RIM, explained to us the particulars of sweater design. <i>Benetta Barnett,</i> director of merchandising, Cenett International/ Arrow Inc., was most helpful regarding the procedures of planning, sourcing, and executing a line. <i>Lisa Goldman,</i> CAD/CAM systems director for Donnkenny Apparel, Inc., <i>Wayne Slossberg</i> of Lectra Systems, and <i>Don Newcomb</i> of F.I.T. worked with us regarding the state-of-the-art use of computers in the apparel industry. </p> <p> A very special thank you is due to <i>Professor Wallace Sloves</i> of F I.T. for sharing with us the know-how he acquired throughout many years of experience fitting garments on live models and couture customers. His help with the section on fitting was invaluable. We are also deeply indebted to our friend and colleague, the designer <i>George Simonton.</i> He and his sample room staff worked with us in developing the chapter on tailored garment design. But George was more than a technical resource; he also served as an enthusiastic cheerleader along every step of the way as this book took shape. </p> <p> In getting this edition ready for publication, we received unstintingly generous technical support from <i>Dr. Robert Jaffe</i> and <i>Nirdi Relis.</i> Thank you, thank you! </p> <p> Finally, we want to especially thank our students, who gave us essential feedback and with their enthusiasm inspired us to go on from the beginning to the completion of this work. </p> <p> HILDE JAFFE<br> NURIE RELIS </p></p><h2>Change Your Energy: Healing Crystals for Health, Wealth, Love &amp; Luck</h2><p>Krista Mitchell, known as &#x201c;The Rock Whisperer&#x201d; for her fresh take on healing with crystals, is one of the world&#x2019;s most famous crystal therapists and a counsel to leading figures in the arts, television, film, fashion, and more.

Drawing on in-depth interviews with painters, sculptors, writers, singers, dancers, and actors, Wuthnow includes the spiritual insights of accomplished artists who have gained prominence as Broadway performers, gospel singers, jazz musicians, poets, Native American painters, weavers, dancers, and installation artists. He profiles such national figures as novelist Madeleine L'Engle, playwright Tony Kushner, photographer Andres Serrano, sculptor Greg Wyatt, dancer Carla DeSola, and woodcarver David Ellsworth.<br><br>Situating these artists' reflections in the context of wider cultural ferment, Wuthnow argues that spirituality is coming increasingly to focus on the inherently ineffable character of the sacred&#x2014;what artists refer to as divine mystery. As growing numbers of Americans doubt the adequacy of religious creeds in defining the sacred, they are turning to artists who seek a more intuitive sense of the sacred through symbols and imagery.<br><br>These artists provide rich insights into the social and cultural problems of our time. Many have been shaped by the growing ethnic, racial, and religious diversity of the United States. Many are at the cutting edge of new thinking about body, mind, and spirit, and many are seeking ways to integrate their understandings of spirituality with interests in nature and preserving the environment. For readers interested in exploring contemporary spirituality or engaged in spiritual pursuits of their own, this engaging, elegantly written, and erudite book will answer many questions about the changing moral and spiritual role of creativity and the arts.</p><p><i>Creative Spirituality</i>, an intriguing discussion on the artistic process, zeroes in on the mysterious place where creativity and the sacred meet. As more and more artists admit to seeking and experiencing divine inspiration, author Robert Wuthnow (<i>After Heaven</i>) decided to examine this important link. Relying on his expansive knowledge of spirituality and culture, he offers this groundbreaking book that speaks to the ways morality and spirit influence the modern arts. <p> Wuthnow profiles artists such as writer Madeleine L'Engle and playwright Tony Kushner to show how creators connect are inspired by the sacred. For instance, artist Nancy Chinn gleans inspiration from the Bible, as many renowned painters have before her. "A biblical character such as Eve, Lot's wife, or the daughter of Jephtha captures her attention, and she creates an image that expresses something about this character," Wuthnow writes of Chinn. Yet Chinn also feels that her art moves beyond interpreting a religious figure. "She believes there is a spiritual and material reality beyond herself, which interacts with her during the creative process," explains Wuthnow. Herein lies an important point: many artists often see themselves as spiritual vessels as well as creators. In other chapters, he profiles artists who have soothed their personal angst or a destructive childhood by creatively expressing their spiritual growth. Moving beyond the cozy, self-help tone of the <i>The Artist's Way</i>, this is an impressive and intelligent manifesto for creators, seekers, and art scholars alike. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><i>"Creative Spirituality</i> is a fascinating, brilliant, and suggestive book, to be read and appreciated both for its spiritual insights and for the author's astute observations on artistic creativity and spiritual practice. Robert Wuthnow explores the intimate engagements of art and spirituality in their common quests for meaning. This volume represents a substantial contribution to the growing literature on art and religion in the United States and an intelligent appeal to the artist and the truth-seeker in each of us."&#x2014;Sally M. Promey is author of <i>Painting Religion in Public</i> and coauthor of <i>The Visual Culture of American Religions </i><br><br>"Wuthnow's careful listening to the voices of working artists speaking of their work, and his analysis of the rich variety of their experiences, show the universally human, transforming power of creativity. Creative practice reveals itself here as a primary spiritual practice. While some of these artists follow a traditional religious path and make fascinating connections between their working experience and their religious faith others speak directly of spirituality as a discovering of the power of Spirit. Whether religious or not, their voices are witness to the holy power of human creativity and to the mystery in which it leads."&#x2014;Reverend Donald Schell, St. Gregory of Nyssa Episcopal Church, San Francisco<br><br>"Robert Wuthnow has written a brilliant, insightful exploration of how contemporary artists struggle to express their deepest spiritual yearnings. At a time when the notion of spirituality seems inchoate, artists, writers and musicians can often eloquently articulate the mysterious <i>otherness</i> of our lives. Especially powerful are the personal testimonials which reveal the empowerment of transcendence over alienation and disbelief."&#x2014;Marci Whitney-Schenck, Publisher and Editor, <i>Christianity and the Arts</i><br><br>"Here one finds wonderful stories about artists and of the creative spirituality arising out of their work. Wuthnow goes beyond telling us simply that these are people living at the edges of our culture, suggesting that they are spiritual models for our time&#x2014;people who cultivate spiritual depth through sustained practice, or doing something that is fresh, expressive, and worthwhile. The book addresses the serious, many-sided aspects of their search&#x2014;indeed, of our search&#x2014;for 'moments of transcendence' today."&#x2014;Wade Clark Roof, J. F.

Gorging themselves on the sea urchins that grazed among the kelp, these small charismatic mammals seemed to give little back in return. But as Estes dug deeper, he unearthed a far more complex relationship between the otter and its underwater environment, discovering that otters play a critical role in driving positive ecosystem dynamics.

Leading mathematicians like Hariot, Stevin, Galileo, and Cavalieri began referring to their field in terms drawn from the exploration accounts of Columbus and Magellan. As enterprising explorers in search of treasures of knowledge, these mathematicians described themselves as sailing the treacherous seas of mathematics, facing shipwreck on the shoals of paradox, and seeking shelter and refuge on the shores of geometrical demonstrations. Mathematics, formerly praised for its logic, clarity, and inescapable truths, was for them a hazardous voyage in inhospitable geometrical lands.</p> <p>Significantly, many of the same practitioners who promoted the vision of mathematics as heroic exploration also played central roles in developing the most important mathematical innovation of the period&#x2015;the infinitesimal methods. This was no coincidence: the heroic tales of exploration and discovery helped shape a new form of mathematical practice, complete with new questions, new acceptable answers, and new standards of evidence. It was this new vision of mathematics as a grand adventure that allowed for the development of the new techniques that led to the Newtonian calculus.</p> <p>In demonstrating this, the book moves from real voyages to imaginary ones, from the coasts of the Canadian Arctic to the tropical forests of Guyana, and from the inner structure of matter to the intricacies of the mathematical continuum. Throughout, a common rhetoric and imagery of exploration and discovery run like a thread through these diverse elements and bind them together.</p></p><p>&#x201c;This is one of the most important books to appear in the history of early modern science. Moving into an uncharted field, namely mathematics and the turn toward infinitesimals, Alexander develops a controversial argument&#x2014;and that is a tribute to its originality.

Thus commenced the first wave of Byzantine iconoclasm, which ran its violent course until 787, when the underlying issues were temporarily resolved at the Second Council of Nicaea. In 815, a second great wave of iconoclasm was set off, only to end in 842 when the icons were restored to the churches of the East and the iconoclasts excommunicated.</p><p>The iconoclast controversies have long been understood as marking major fissures between the Western and Eastern churches. Thomas F. X. Noble reveals that the lines of division were not so clear. It is traditionally maintained that the Carolingians in the 790s did not understand the basic issues involved in the Byzantine dispute. Noble contends that there was, in fact, a significant Carolingian controversy about visual art and, if its ties to Byzantine iconoclasm were tenuous, they were also complex and deeply rooted in central concerns of the Carolingian court. Furthermore, he asserts that the Carolingians made distinctive and original contributions to the whole debate over religious art.</p><p><i>Images, Iconoclasm, and the Carolingians</i> is the first book to provide a comprehensive study of the Western response to Byzantine iconoclasm. By comparing art-texts with laws, letters, poems, and other sources, Noble reveals the power and magnitude of the key discourses of the Carolingian world during its most dynamic and creative decades.</p></p><p>Thomas F. X. Noble is Professor of History at the University of Notre Dame. He is author of several books, including The Republic of St. Peter: The Birth of the Papal State, 680-825, also available from the University of Pennsylvania Press.<p>Introduction</p><blockquote>Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in the heaven above or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.&#x2014;Exodus 20.4<p></p><p>In the history of European art it is difficult to name any one fact more momentous than the admission of the graven image by the Christian Church.&#x2014;Ernst Kitzinger, "The Cult of Images"</p></blockquote><p></p><p>God's words to Moses, with Kitzinger's gloss, take us to the heart of a long, sometimes bitter, and always fascinating chapter in the histories of art, of Christianity, and of Western culture. This book focuses on one important but neglected and misunderstood segment of those histories. Between 790 and 840, in differing circumstances, and with differing aims and intentions, Carolingian writers produced hundreds of pages of intelligent, interesting, and not infrequently polemical writing about Christian art. This book studies and interprets those texts. In about 790 Theodulf of Orl�ans, with the aid of several of his contemporaries, and on the express command of Charlemagne, began to write the <i>Opus Caroli</i>. This was a treatise of several hundred pages that ostensibly formed a response to the decisions of the Second Council of Nicaea of 787, a great assembly that had put a temporary end to Byzantine iconoclasm. Just after 840 Jonas of Orl�ans&#x2014;that he and Theodulf were bishops of the same see is purely coincidental&#x2014;put the finishing touches to his <i>De cultu imaginum</i>. Jonas's treatise, originally begun at the request of Louis the Pious in 827 and completed on the order of Charles the Bald, responded to the iconoclasm of Bishop Claudius of Turin and to much else besides.</p><p>Writings about Christian art, or about what visual arts Christians might have and how they might use them, began with the apologists in the second century. Yet not until the eighth century did the Byzantine world sustain a serious discussion of the appropriateness of Christian figural art. The so-called iconoclastic controversy&#x2014;as always the victors got to name the battle after the losers&#x2014;has been called "one of the greatest political and cultural crises of Byzantium." More than this, it was "undoubtedly one of the major conflicts in the history of the Christian Church. . . . All levels of life were affected by the conflict, all strata of society were involved in the struggle. The fight was violent, bitter and desperate." Not surprisingly, then, a major authority can say that the iconoclastic controversy was "arguably the major manifestation of change and continuity in early medieval Byzantium."</p><p>Byzantine iconoclasm ran two courses. The first lasted from 726 to 787 and the second from 815 to 842. As noted just above, Theodulf wrote the <i>Opus Caroli</i> to respond to the council that put an end to the first phase of iconoclasm. Did a Western controversy exist? If so, was it a great crisis? Did it shake the (Western) Christian Church to its foundations? Does it reveal significant forces of change?</p><p>Usually the answers to these questions are all in the negative. The Western image discussions are seen as a <i>Nebenerscheinung</i>, as a "side show," to the Byzantine main event. It is usually argued that the Carolingians in the 790s simply did not understand the basic issues involved in the Byzantine dispute. In the harshest telling, the Carolingians are alleged to have lacked Greek books and learning, as well as an understanding of the philosophical and theological traditions of the Greek Church. In the mildest telling, the Carolingians had poor translations of the <i>acta</i> of II Nicaea, perhaps indeed a mere extract from those voluminous documents. Carolingian writings were, in any case, without discernible influence on the continuing course of Byzantine iconoclasm and, say what one will about the Nicene <i>acta</i>, the subsequent writings of ninth-century Byzantine image theologians were either unknown or unremarked in the West. Although thirty years ago Peter Brown said that the iconoclastic controversy was "in the grips of a crisis of overinterpretation," no one could then or would now say the same about the West. To this day there exists neither a comprehensive description or explanation of the Western response to Byzantine iconoclasm or a thorough account of Carolingian reflections on images. This book constitutes a first such attempt.</p><p>There was, in fact, a Carolingian controversy about visual art but its ties to Byzantine iconoclasm are tenuous and complex. Thus there is an opportunity to ask what the Carolingian discussion actually is linked to. I do not deny that Theodulf took it as his first task to respond to the second Nicene council. But I do assert that his response is rooted deeply in central concerns of the Carolingian court in the years between about 780 and 800. Goaded by II Nicaea the Carolingians expressed themselves in distinctive ways about problems that were important to them and that were fundamentally different from many, but not all, of the problems that exercised the Byzantines. Viewed in this way, the <i>Opus Caroli</i> becomes less an incompetent or uncomprehending response to Byzantium than a cunning, albeit unfinished and unpolished, statement of basic Frankish concerns.</p><p>When the Franks returned to the subject of images in the 820s, they were prompted to do so by the Byzantines and, as in the 790s, traced a distinctive path. Emperor Michael II, a mild iconophobe, wrote to Louis the Pious to enlist his aid and support and to explain his own actions in the East. Louis assembled his theologians. At Paris in 825 they produced a large dossier of materials that seem to respond only partially to the letter of Michael II and to correspond only in oblique ways with the issues that had attracted the attention of Theodulf and Charlemagne's other key advisers. Once again, however, the context for the treatises written at Paris in 825 is to be sought amid major preoccupations of Louis the Pious and his key associates in the first fifteen or so years of the reign of Charlemagne's heir.</p><p>At just about the time when Louis's theologians were gathering in Paris the Frankish world encountered a home-grown altercation. Claudius of Turin, the Septimanian, probably Visigothic, bishop, theologian, and arch controversialist, went on a rampage of image destruction and iconophobic propaganda. Louis directed Jonas of Orl�ans, who had presided at the Paris deliberations, to respond to Claudius. He did so by beginning his <i>De cultu imaginum</i> but under slightly mysterious circumstances laid it aside, unfinished. Other writers, however, took up pens&#x2014;one almost said cudgels&#x2014;against Claudius: Theodemir, the abbot of Psalmody and Dungal, the chief schoolman in Pavia, most prominently. Agobard of Lyon, meanwhile, weighed in on his own with a treatise that expressed reservations about Christian art much graver than those articulated by the Paris theologians, Theodimir, or Dungal, but less reckless than those of Claudius. Still other writers&#x2014;Hrabanus Maurus, Einhard, and Walafrid Strabo, to mention the three most prominent ones&#x2014;wrote on art too but did so in terms more approving than those expressed by Agobard and Claudius, yet quite different on key points from those of Jonas and Dungal. The context for this Carolingian logomachy is the turbulent world of the 830s when the Franks fought civil wars, endured foreign attacks, and attenuated the buoyant optimism that had characterized the reign of Charlemagne and the early years of Louis the Pious.</p><p>Standard works on Carolingian art history rarely discuss the treatises and documents just mentioned. To a degree this neglect is justifiable because many of these Carolingian texts about Christian art seem to have very little to do with art per se. As I shall repeatedly argue, controversies that were sparked by some problem having to do with art turned into major statements of or else quarrels about contemporary issues that did not have Christian art as their primary subject matter. Perhaps this is not so odd. Throughout history, heated debates about artistic representation, and the actual destruction of public and private works of art, have been by-products of other kinds of social, political, or religious movements. One thinks immediately of Protestant iconoclasm in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; of the political iconoclasm of the French Revolution; of the ideological iconoclasm of both Fascist and Communist states and their successors; or of contemporary American disputes over flag burning and public subsidies for artistic work that some people deem blasphemous or obscene. The iconoclastic moment in these movements almost always provides the careful observer with a sharp view of the stresses and tears in the social fabric of a given place or time. In short, I shall ask the reader to look with me at certain problems in Carolingian history in ways that would seem perfectly normal to historians of other times and places. That is the broad view. In the narrow view, Carolingian historians may discover new things here as I invite them to reflect with me on neglected texts and problems. And I hope to persuade art historians to think in new ways about the subjects of their investigations.</p><p>Thus far the large issues to which this book is addressed. The next few pages provide a chapter-by-chapter orientation to how the book actually proceeds. Chapters 4 to 7 form the heart of the book. The first three chapters are not merely introductory, however. By looking in detail at the period from the fourth century to the eighth, these chapters establish the language, issues, and ideas which the Carolingians answered, modified, neglected. The chapters are long, but each addresses a basic and coherent bundle of problems within specific cultural and chronological contexts.</p><p>The first chapter turns to the ancient and late antique Mediterranean homeland both of Byzantine and Frankish art and of Christianity. I treat several issues in summary, synoptic fashion. What kinds of discussions about art took place in the Mediterranean world before the outbreak of Byzantine iconoclasm? What exactly are sacred icons, and what place do they occupy within the larger context of figural art generally, of support for or opposition to such art, and of religious practices in the East and in the West? What kinds of discussions of art took place in the West before the outbreak of iconoclasm and what cultic practices, if any, can be associated with works of art in the West? Without here anticipating the discussion that will follow, for the purposes of this study I acknowledge that any image could be an icon, but posit that sacred icons are not images of a particular style, size, or location but instead images that did, or that were expected to do, something. They were images to which cult was paid. These are huge subjects with elaborate, complex, and contentious bibliographies. Our aim here will merely be to pick out certain key themes so as better to understand some basic Carolingian positions. In sum, Chapter 1 asks what language, texts, and precedents were available to be accepted, rejected, or modified in the eighth century.</p><p>Chapter 2 opens with an inspection of a few battle sites in the <i>guerre des savants</i> over Byzantine iconoclasm. Everyone agrees that the Byzantine iconophilia following the first phase of Byzantine iconoclasm occasioned the <i>Opus Caroli</i>, so it is imperative to explore what else Theodulf and company <i>could</i> have responded to. This chapter extends the discussion begun in Chapter 1 of how East and West were alike and different in daily cult practice as well as in theological speculation. Another important objective of this chapter is to remind readers more familiar with the West than the East that recent scholarship has decidedly reduced the magnitude of the Byzantine controversy, the above quotations from Ladner and Florovsky notwithstanding. Byzantine iconoclasm was uneven, episodic, and never as devastating in human or material terms as formerly believed. Proceeding to the Carolingian world with this new understanding of Byzantium in mind will help us to see that we are not dealing with the bizarre and inexplicable asymmetry of a civilizational shock at one end of the Mediterranean that produced only a ripple at the other end. Finally, another important objective of this chapter will be a slimming of the intellectual, primarily theological, aspects of eighth-century iconoclasm, East and West. For too long scholars, mostly Byzantinists and most prominently the Russians among them, have gotten away with both proleptic and cataleptic readings of the eighth century that permit virtually all understandings of sacred icons to have been present then. If one assumes that the soaring theological flights of ninth-century writers such as the Patriarch Nicephorus and Abbot Theodore of Studion were already present in the early and middle decades of the eighth century, or that the lofty early eighth-century theology of John of Damascus was pervasive at the time of II Nicaea, then it is easy to portray Theodulf's theology as an ugly, flightless bird. We shall try to interpret the history a little closer to the order in which it actually happened.</p><p>Chapter 3 provides a discussion of the Western background to the <i>Opus Caroli</i>. The Anglo-Saxon Bede (673-735), whose writings were well known to the Carolingians, expressed himself on art several times in a variety of contexts. We shall find traces of his influence. The popes, moreover, with whom the Franks entered into a solemn alliance in the 750s, were deeply distressed by Byzantine iconoclasm and explicitly objected to it on numerous occasions. From Gregory II (716-31) to Hadrian I (772-95) popes wrote frequently about the image crisis and held a series of councils that addressed images-among other things. Beginning in the 730s the Franks and the popes entered into increasingly intense relations with one another. There is some evidence that the Franks began taking notice of Byzantine iconoclasm in the 750s but the surviving sources convey little sense that images represented right away an important or interesting problem for the Franks. One task of Chapter 3, therefore, is to explain the differing perspectives of the popes and of the Franks on Byzantine religious policy in general, and on religious art in particular, in the central decades of the eighth century. Problems of rulership and church government were critical to those perspectives, but so too were cult practices associated with art. How was art actually used in the Frankish world, in Rome, and in Byzantium? In what ways did the Franko-papal alliance condition the partners' reactions to art, to Byzantine iconolcasm, and to one another? By the end of Chapter 3 the textual, political, and devotional scene will have been set with sufficient precision and clarity to make possible an understanding of Theodulf's work in his place and time.</p><p>Chapter 4 offers my reading of the <i>Opus Caroli</i> within the specific context of the Carolingian court during the most decisive, creative, productive years of the reign of Charlemagne. The chapter begins with a discussion of the making of the <i>Opus Caroli</i> that depends heavily on the magisterial work of Ann Freeman but that adds to her findings some perspectiv...</p></p><h2>Lab Manual for Gates&#39; Introduction to Electronics, 6th</h2><p>Lab Manual for Gates' Introduction to Electronics<br><br></p><p></p><h2>Medicine and Health Through Time: Student&#39;s Book (Essentials Series)</h2><p>This is an SHP Official Text which means it has been created by the Schools History Project for use with the SHP specifications.

Can I think your beliefs are absurd but still respect you?</p><p>In <i>The Virtues of Our Vices</i>, philosopher Emrys Westacott takes a fresh look at important everyday ethical questions--and comes up with surprising answers. He makes a compelling argument that some of our most common vices--rudeness, gossip, snobbery, tasteless humor, and disrespect for others' beliefs--often have hidden virtues or serve unappreciated but valuable purposes. For instance, there are times when rudeness may be necessary to help someone with a problem or to convey an important message. Gossip can foster intimacy between friends and curb abuses of power. And dubious humor can alleviate existential anxieties.</p><p>Engaging, funny, and philosophically sophisticated, <i>The Virtues of Our Vices</i> challenges us to rethink conventional wisdom when it comes to everyday moral behavior.</p></p><p><p>"Works on ethics often float above the flux and confusion of everyday life. Not this engaging book! Brimming with lively examples, Westacott's meditation reveals the bright side of some of our darker practices, such as gossip, sick humor, and rude behavior. While the writing is breezy, the analysis is both rigorous and lucid. By the turn of the last page, the delighted reader is sure to have developed a more nuanced and perhaps forgiving grasp of some of our most common transgressions."<b>--Gordon Marino, editor of <i>Ethics: The Essential Writings</i></b></p><p>"Philosophy should encompass not only the summits of life-and-death issues but the lowlands and occasional quicksand of everyday manners. Emrys Westacott is an ideal guide to this terrain, especially to the ethics of guilty verbal pleasures.<i>The Virtues of Our Vices</i> is a provocative exploration of the big issues underlying small talk."<b>--Edward Tenner, author of<i>Why Things Bite Back: Technology and the Revenge of Unintended Consequences</i></b></p><p>"With insight and rigor, Emrys Westacott shows that what is small is not necessarily trivial, that analytic precision is compatible with fully accepting the messiness of real life, and that what matters is often lost in the cracks of the obvious, big moral debates of the day. This is a refreshingly original work which promises to bring quotidian ethics the wider attention it deserves."<b>--Julian Baggini, cofounder and editor-in-chief of the<i>Philosopher's Magazine</i></b></p><p>"If you have ever been accused of being rude when you were merely stating the truth, or called a gossip because you like to dwell on other people's actions, Westacott is for you. His linked studies of everyday vices offer elegant analysis of the goods that lurk in behavior that is usually condemned. This wise book is practical philosophy in the best sense."<b>--Mark Kingwell, --Mark Kingwell, author of<i>In Pursuit of Happiness: Better Living from Plato to Prozac</i></b></p><p>"Emrys Westacott writes in an accessible way, and often with humor, about topics that are of wide interest. He is right that the ethical questions that confront ordinary people in everyday life are important, even if philosophy has tended to ignore them."<b>--David Benatar, editor of <i>Ethics for Everyday</i></b></p><p>"In this enjoyable book, Westacott shows that the question of whether rudeness, snobbery, and other vices are wrong is more nuanced and delicate than it might appear."<b>--Caspar Hare, author of<i>On Myself, and Other, Less Important Subjects</i></b></p><b>Emrys Westacott</b> is professor of philosophy at Alfred University in Alfred, New York.

Samuelson, MS, PhD, Associate Chair of Research and Graduate Studies, University of Florida, College of Medicine, Department of S.A. Clinical Sciences, Gainesville, FL"Before this book there was only one real Veterinary Histology text, and that was Bacha and Bacha, a great book with lots of pictures, but zero textual content, nothing to explain the &#x2018;Why?&#x2019; of Histology. Samuelson&#x2019;s book is a totally different story. There are hundreds of histology pictures, macroscopic images, E.M. pictures, giving you the big picture right down to the tiny little details. And if that wasn&#x2019;t good enough, the text explains histology!!! I find histology so difficult to understand, but Samuelson&#x2019;s book explains all of those odd terms you hear in lectures but can&#x2019;t remember. My only gripe is that there isn&#x2019;t a Picture Index, to let you reference a particular picture, and the part of the book covering the liver is smaller than I would like, but when you consider that other Histo texts are just pages of pictures with no useful information this is a huge leap forward. I still have my copy of Bacha and Bacha Histology, but it&#x2019;s going to be getting very dusty on the shelf with my other redundant books."<br>--- 3rd Year Veterinary Medicine student, Royal Veterinary College, London, UK<br>"Textbooks of veterinary histology are rare and the textbook of Don A. Samuelson fulfils this obvious lack. It is a good book. It is richly illustrated by high quality colour photographs which are of great help to the students for interpretation of the histological slides. The text is clearly written and well linked to the illustrations giving the reader a strong introduction to the different structures analysed. The content is appropriate to our study program... there is no doubt that it constitutes a very good book and it will be recommended to the students as a reference textbook.

It highlights the connections of the war to earlier conflicts in the region and examines the human impact of the war on neighboring countries, focusing particularly on the ways in which the Korean War shaped regional cross-border movements of people, goods, and ideas (including hopes and fears). It also considers the lasting consequences of these movements for the region&#x2019;s society and politics.</p><p>Tessa Morris-Suzuki is professor in the School of Culture, History and Language, College of Asia and the Pacific, the Australian National University.This remarkable book&#x2019;s unique approach makes it one of most important works we have on the Korean War. Rather than attempt to answer traditional questions regarding origins or battle tactics, it traces the domino effect of the war on governments and peoples peripherally related to the actual slaughter itself. In providing a multi-dimensional perspective on the extent to which this war profoundly affected the broader region, the authors advance our knowledge of the &#x2018;forgotten&#x2019; war while offering a model for adopting a wider perspective on wars in general. This study will be essential reading to all those interested in Korea and modern war. (Mark Caprio, Rikkyo University)<br><br>The collection of essays in this anthology represents an important moment in the study of the Korean War. First, the field of Korean War studies is no longer dominated by macroanalyses of Cold War geopolitics. The &#x201c;view from above&#x201d; will no doubt continue, as it should, but this volume&#x2019;s second contribution is how &#x201c;forgotten&#x201d; can be redefined. Typically, &#x201c;forgotten&#x201d; means the war&#x2019;s absence from US historical memory. Few Americans learn much about the war in high school history classes, and even fewer are aware of the war&#x2019;s role in establishing a permanent military industrial complex in the US. But these essays detail how Japan and Taiwan&#x2019;s participation in the world is forgotten or ignored, the effect of the war on the lives of individuals not from the peninsula, and the unexpected connections between the war and countries like Mongolia. For example, one essay describes the lone Japanese POW and how his life ties together several wars, countries, and armies into an integrated East Asian and micro-historical view of the war. A wonderful balance to the top-heavy studies of the Korean War, which students will appreciate.<br>Summing Up: Highly recommended. All public and academic levels/libraries.

No forbidden foods, no calorie counting. Welcome to diet liberation.<br><br> Would you ever consider going to the kitchen in the morning and grabbing five slices of bread for breakfast? No? Just one bagel is more like it, right? Well, your morning bagel is equivalent to eating five slices of bread. Your steak at dinner is equal to the protein in eighteen eggs. And that huge bowl of pasta you had at lunch is anybody&#x2019;s guess. Nobody likes to cut back but the cold hard facts are in: Portion sizes have steadily increased over the past thirty years and our collective waistlines are ballooning right along with them.<br><br> You may need to eat a little less if you want to lose weight, but with <i>The Portion Teller Plan </i>you can eat all of your favorite foods. Nutrition and portion size expert Dr. Lisa Young presents an individualized guide to eating according to your <i>portion personality</i> and food preferences. You&#x2019;ll learn a simple system of visuals&#x2013;a deck of cards, a baseball, your own hand&#x2013;to help gauge portion size. You&#x2019;ll be able to eat out, eat in, cheat, and eat on the road without ever being a portion victim again.</p><p>Lisa R. Young, Ph.D., R.D., C.D.N., is a nutrition consultant and faculty member at New York University. Dr. Young has been counseling overweight adults and children for more than 15 years, has published numerous articles on portion sizes, and frequently lectures on nutrition. Widely considered an expert on portion sizes, Young is regularly featured in national publications including the<i> New York Times</i>, the<i> Wall Street Journal, USA Today, </i>the <i>Boston Globe, </i>the <i>Washington Post,</i> <i>Newsweek, Self, Fitness, </i>and <i>Glamour</i>. She has also been featured on national television including ABC News, CBS News, and CNN, and was in the film <i>Super Size Me</i>.Introduction<br><br><i>I&#x2019;ve been on a constant diet for the last two decades. I&#x2019;ve lost a total of 789 pounds. By all accounts, I should be hanging from a charm bracelet. <br></i><br>-Erma Bombeck<br><b><br></b>When I started counseling people on how to lose weight in the late 1980s, I heard many diet war stories. The same complaints came up over and over again: The food is boring. I feel hungry. I feel deprived. There are too many rules. The most common lament was: How can I possibly follow all these rules for the rest of my life? I saw firsthand that no matter how suc?cessful a strict diet is in the short term, it rarely works in the long run. At the same time as I was learning these stories of dieting failures from my clients, I started noticing something going on around me&#x2013;the size of food was grow?ing. I noted the extra mound of pasta at dinner, the increase in the diameter of a pizza, the ballooning of bagels, the upward creep of all fast-food and restaurant portions. This change was pretty gradual, so most people didn&#x2019;t pay attention. It wasn&#x2019;t until recently, when the word &#x201c;supersize&#x201d; became part of the vernacular, almost a clich� to describe overgrown portions, that peo?ple started to realize what was happening to their food&#x2013;and to their bodies. Along with the supersize culture came a supersize America that has collec?tively gained weight at an unprecedented rate in the past few decades. <br><br>As I gathered more information about the growth of portion sizes for my Ph.D. at New York University, I knew that any weight-loss program had to take into account two things: (1) a realistic, personalized eating plan that works for life, and (2) an education in exactly how large portions had be?come, retraining perceptions. Instead of seeing just another muffin, I wanted my clients to see a <i>huge </i>muffin. And then smartsize it! <br><br>I developed this program because I didn&#x2019;t think that the diets out there were realistic. Not only are they hard to follow, but they seem to ignore how large our foods have become. Look around you at the diet programs today&#x2013; almost all of them are based on the idea that you have to cut certain foods, or even entire food groups, from your diet. They claim that it&#x2019;s the carbs, the fat, or the sugars that are making you fat. The entire diet industry seems to focus on what we put in our mouths rather than how much of it we consume. They focus on which foods are good or bad, healthy or unhealthy, a &#x201c;diet&#x201d; food or a restricted food. This approach is at odds with how people really eat. It&#x2019;s not the carbs or the fats that are making us gain weight. It&#x2019;s not <i>what </i>we eat, it&#x2019;s <i>how much </i>we eat. It&#x2019;s portion size that is making us fat. <br><br>Did you know that a typical bagel today has almost the same calories and nutrient value as five slices of bread? You probably wouldn&#x2019;t think twice about having a bagel on the run, but you would know you were overdoing it if you grabbed five slices of bread on the way to the office. Once you know what a bagel is &#x201c;worth,&#x201d; you&#x2019;ll see your breakfast in a new way. You won&#x2019;t need calorie charts, weights, scales, or calculators to understand what a healthy portion is. There&#x2019;s no getting around it: In order to lose weight, you have to limit calories. But on this program, you won&#x2019;t have to count them! What you&#x2019;ll do is develop portion-size awareness. You&#x2019;ll get a basic under?standing of what your body needs and <i>how much </i>of it you should be eating. Armed with this awareness, you can go anywhere&#x2013;out to dinner, an all-you-can-eat buffet, a cocktail party, or a home-cooked meal&#x2013;and know exactly how much you&#x2019;re eating. All you need to do is to smartsize instead of super?size. <br><br>With smartsizing, there are no rigid prescriptions, no &#x201c;first week on, sec?ond week off &#x201d; foods&#x2013;in fact, no restricted foods whatsoever. It&#x2019;s all about awareness: portion-size awareness, nutrition awareness, and self-awareness. You can eat what you want as long as it fits into your own eating plan. The beauty of this program is that you can take it as far as you want; you can work the entire program, which includes detailed instructions on how to keep the Portion Teller Diary, tips and activities for downsizing your portions, and spe?cific strategies for dining out, shopping, and making your home more portion-friendly. Or you can choose instead to focus on a basic understand?ing of portion sizes and put portion control into action in your daily life, leav?ing a few bites on your plate at a restaurant, eating only half a sandwich, or switching from a large glass of orange juice to a fresh orange. If you make these changes and no others, you can lose between ten to twenty pounds in one year without even feeling the pinch of deprivation. Small, simple changes add up. I&#x2019;ve watched it happen with my clients countless times, and I know we can make smartsizing work for you. <br><br>Smartsizing doesn&#x2019;t promise a magic pill, instant weight loss, or overly dramatic results in the first few days. What it does offer is a time-tested, per?sonalized, and sane alternative to unhealthy crash diets with short-term re?sults. Smartsizing works. I&#x2019;ve seen client after client&#x2013;many who spent years on the up-and-down yo-yo diet-go-round&#x2013;lose weight by smartsizing and keep it off for the long run, all the while eating foods they love. Nothing makes me happier than a client who says, &#x201c;I never knew it was so easy. I don&#x2019;t stress out about food anymore.&#x201d; If you smartsize it, you won&#x2019;t have to change your life, just your relationship to food. By the end of the book, I guarantee that you will never look at an oversized restaurant entr�e, a humongous muf?fin, or a mound of pasta the same way again. Instead, you will see your food in terms of healthy portions. Again, the choice of exactly how much and what you eat will be up to you. The Portion Teller program gives you every?thing you need to make your own choices, eat the foods that you love, and still lose weight and keep it off. Welcome to diet liberation. <br><br>One<br>America Expands<br><i>I've been on a diet for two weeks <br>and all I lost is fourteen days.</i><br><br>-Totie Fields<br>If you've said anything like this recently, you're not alone. We spend enormous amounts of time, energy, and money on weight-loss programs, diet pills, shakes, prepackaged low-cal meals, fat- and sugar-free foods, and the latest diet books and products that promise a quick fix for our weight problems. The sad fact is that our investments are not paying off. No matter what we seem to do, we are gaining weight. And lots of it. Recent studies show that almost two-thirds of American adults are overweight. This is a staggering statistic, one that confounds nutritionists as well as the average person who wants to maintain a healthy weight. While most Americans are scratching their heads about what and how to eat--trying to pick from the confusing array of diets that are the current rage--the reason for the epidemic of obesity in this country can be traced to one simple fact: We eat too much.<i><br></i><br>Are we a nation of gluttons? I don't think so. It's the size of our food, not the size of our appetites that's to blame. The portions, servings, helpings, slices, and amounts of what we eat have grown dramatically over the past few decades. Just look around: Everywhere you go, you are encouraged to buy huge sizes. A Double Whopper at Burger King is nearly 1,000 calories; a large order of French fries at McDonald's is 540 calories. A Double Gulp at 7-Eleven is nearly 800 calories. The jumbo bucket of popcorn at a movie theater is up to 1,640 calories. The Hungry-Man XXL frozen dinner, with a slogan that says "It's good to be full!" weighs in at 1 1/2 pounds with 1,000 calories, a meal that packs enough heft for two. When presented with all this food, who can blame us? We can't help but eat more calories than we can burn. So we gain weight.<br><br>As the portion sizes offered to us have gotten bigger, so have we. Since I'm a nutritionist by training, I had some idea that America's collective waistline was growing, but it really hit me when I saw a dietary intake survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics in 1994. The shocking results? The average American adult gained eight pounds--that's eight pounds <i>per person</i>--in the 1980s. That might not sound like a lot, but compare it to earlier decades. In the 1960s and 1970s, the average weight of American adults increased only slightly, by a pound or two at most in the course of each decade. It's not just that we were heavier than ever, but we were gaining weight at a much faster rate. Why had weight gain accelerated so rapidly in such a short period of time? I knew it couldn't be genetic; the gene pool simply doesn't change that fast. What was it?<br><br>I had heard most of the reasons nutritionists were giving for the obesity epidemic--too much couch-potatoing in front of TVs and computers, changes in exercise patterns, unhealthy snacking and fast-food feasting. But I knew that these explanations couldn't possibly be the whole enchilada. I looked into the national exercise trends and found that there was virtually no change in exercise patterns during that time. So it had to be something else, something circumstantial, a change in our culture that was causing such a rapid weight gain in just three decades. I suspected that the cause was portion sizes.<br><br>I figured our national weight gain had more to do with <i>how much</i> we eat than <i>what</i> we eat. So I went to look at the research that had been done on portion sizes, to see if there was a connection between the trend toward supersized food portions and weight gain. To my surprise, there was no research. Nothing. Nobody seemed to have done any, not professors, government nutritionists, or weight-loss counselors. In fact, very few people even noticed that our food portions were growing so quickly. I couldn't find any hard-and-fast information on how big our food portions are, what portions weigh, how much they've changed over time, and how they compare to federal standards like the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Guide Pyramid that came out in 1992 or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) food labels. Here I was, surrounded by nutrition experts and academics, and no one was talking about, much less studying, portion sizes.<br><br>I decided to conduct my own research. I spent a rather hot summer riding my bicycle around Manhattan, talking to deli owners, restaurateurs, and fast-food workers, asking them all sorts of questions about what they were serving and what people were eating. I became a portion detective, carrying around a food scale, a camera, and a notebook, recording the exact size and weight of typical foods that you can pick up at places around Manhattan--a vendor cart, a take-out joint, a Times Square restaurant chain, a deli--from places you grab a quick bite on the go, to a four-course sit-down dinner. What I found was appalling. I had no idea how enormous typical food servings had become. I found bagels the size of seat cushions and muffins as big as a bread loaf. I weighed different foods--street-vendor pretzels, black-and-white cookies, prepackaged muffins, and even fruits, like apples, that are closer to a cantaloupe in size and weight. I took pictures of all-you-can-eat buffets and pasta plates overflowing with pounds of noodles and tubs of sauce. I measured cups, plates, wineglasses, and margarita buckets, all gargantuan in size. I combed through <i>Zagat</i>, the popular restaurant guide, and found restaurants praised for their all-you-can-eat salad bars and buffets, free refills, two-for-ones, and troughs of pasta, all of which customers consider a selling point, with entries touting "Godzilla-sized burgers," "the biggest subs in the city," and "food piled high on the plate."<i><br><br></i>By the end of the summer, I had a big fat binder, my own "portion museum." It showed comparisons of cup, drink glass, and plate sizes; photos of obscenely large servings of pasta and meat; quotes from restaurant owners; and advertisements that lured customers with both bigger foods and bigger deals. My findings: The foods we buy today are often two to three times, even <i>five times</i>, larger than when they were first introduced into the marketplace.<i><br></i><br><br>portion shockers ***<br><br>* Pizza pies were 10 inches in diameter back in the 1970s. Today Pizza Hut offers the Full House XL Pizza, a 16-inch pie. Little Caesars sells the Big! Big! Pizza, with the large measuring 16 to 18 inches with a slogan that says: "Bigger is better!" Both Pizza Hut and Little Caesars have discontinued the 10-inch pie.<br><br>* 7-Eleven stores started selling 12- and 20-ounce sodas in the early 1970s. By 1988 they were selling the 64-ounce Double Gulp, a half-gallon of soda marketed for one person.<br><br>* The famous Hershey chocolate bar weighed 0.6 ounce its first year on the market. Now the standard bar weighs 1.6 ounces, almost three times its original weight. Other sizes include the 2.6-, 4-, 7-, and 8-ounce bars. M&amp;M/Mars increased the size of several of their most popular chocolate candy bars <i>four times</i> since 1970.<br><br>* The most popular burger places have all increased the size of their hamburgers: Burger King's original hamburger weighed 3.9 ounces, which included the bun and all. Today's Burger King burger is 4.4 ounces; the Whopper Junior is 6 ounces; and the Double Whopper is 12.6 ounces. McDonald's also started out with a pretty small patty--1.6 ounces precooked--but has upped it to the Double Quarter Pounder with 8 ounces, five times more meat. Wendy's, the chain that asked the famous question, "Where's the beef?" answered it with a triple-patty burger with 12 ounces of meat.<br><br>* Even diet food has grown in size; in the mid-1990s, Weight Watchers introduced Smart Ones, with larger portion sizes, and Lean Cuisine offered Hearty Portions, a heftier frozen dinner, with 100 more calories. The irony of diet food that advertised bigger sizes with more calories seems lost in the diet industry.<br><br>* At Starbucks the Short cup of coffee, at 8 ounces, is no longer on the menu. The smallest size is Tall, a 12-ounce cup that is nearly twice as big as what used to be considered a regular cup of coffee. Other sizes include the 16-ounce Grande and the 20-ounce Venti.<br><br>* When Chef America added 10 percent more filling to its microwave sandwich Hot Pockets while keeping the price the same, sales increased by 32 percent.<br><br>* The number of new larger-size portion sizes has increased tenfold between 1970 and 2000.</p><h2>An Introduction to Statistical Analysis in Research: With Applications in the Biological and Life Sciences</h2><p><p><b>Provides well-organized coverage of statistical analysis and applications in biology, kinesiology, and physical anthropology with comprehensive insights into the techniques and interpretations of R, SPSS�, Excel�, and Numbers� output</b></p> <p><i>An Introduction to Statistical Analysis in Research: With Applications in the Biological and Life Sciences </i>develops a conceptual foundation in statistical analysis while providing readers with opportunities to practice these skills via research-based data sets in biology, kinesiology, and physical anthropology.

Renehan Jr. narrates the compelling life of Cornelius Vanderbilt: willful progenitor of modern American business. Vanderbilt made his initial fortune building ferry and cargo routes for sailing vessels. Then he moved into steamboats and railroads. With the New York Central, Vanderbilt established the nation's first major integrated rail system, linking New York with Boston, Montreal, Chicago, and St. Louis. At the same time, he played a key role in establishing New York as the financial center of the United States. When he died in 1877, Vanderbilt left a fortune that, in today's dollars, would dwarf that of even Bill Gates. Off Wall Street, Vanderbilt was a hard-drinking egotist and whoremonger devoid of manners or charity. He disinherited most of his numerous children and received an editorial rebuke from Mark Twain for his lack of public giving. <i>Commodore</i> sheds startling new light on many aspects of Vanderbilt's business and private life including, most notably, the revelation that advanced stage syphilis marred his last years. This is the definitive biography of a man whose influence on American life and commerce towers over all who followed him.</p><p><b>Edward J. Rehehan Jr.</b> is the author of several books including <i>Dark Genius of Wall Street</i>, <i>The Kennedys at War</i>, <i>The Lion's Pride</i>, <i>The Secret Six</i>, and <i>John Burroughs</i>. He contributes to such publications as <i>American Heritage</i> and has appeared on the History Channel, C-SPAN, and PBS. He lives in Rhode Island.The latest from Renehan, author most recently of a much-praised biography of another titan of 19th-century business, Jay Gould, is a thorough look at Cornelius Vanderbilt (1794&#x2013;1877), who rose from nothing to amass one of the great fortunes in American history (more than $158 billion in 2005 dollars) in the burgeoning steamship and railroad industries. A brilliant, vicious businessman with little education, manners or patience for fools&#x2014;including his long-suffering wife and 14 children&#x2014;Vanderbilt makes an almost prototypical figure of pure American laissez-faire entrepreneurship. Unfortunately, for significant portions of this bio, the man gets lost behind the icon. Though Renehan's writing proves colorful, insightful and efficient in describing Vanderbilt's spirited early adventures taking on the steamship monopolies of former senator Aaron Ogden and others, the middle third of the book is too often bogged down in details that will appeal mainly to the business-minded&#x2014;an endless cascade of ships (and their vital stats), routes and dollar amounts&#x2014;and overshadow both narrative and character. Still, Vanderbilt's personal life is fascinating; highlights include the Vanderbilts' grand tour of Europe, his lifelong penchant for prostitutes (including the Woodhull sisters, whom Vanderbilt made the first female brokers on Wall Street) and the syphilis-induced madness that plagued his final years&#x2014;material new in this biography and a testament to Renehan's typically assiduous research. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In a career that began as a war correspondent for Newsweek and the Washington Post, Just has lived and written in half a dozen countries, including Britain, France, and Vietnam. His characters often lead public lives as politicians, civil servants, soldiers, artists, and writers. It is the tension between public duty and private conscience that animates much of his fiction, including Forgetfulness. Just and his wife, Sarah Catchpole, divide their time between Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard and Paris.AN UNFINISHED SEASON is a brilliant novel by Ward Just, whose writing is elegant and powerful. Set in the 1950s, the book focuses upon 19-year-old Wilson Ravan, who must confront the Cold War, the union movement, and love, all while trying to understand who his parents really are. Just, who was nominated for the National Book Award for his novel ECHO HOUSE, is a wonderful writer, and the book seems to fly by. Credit also goes to William Dufris, whose reading is both understated and highly effective. Dufris demonstrates a gift for dialogue, particularly in the scenes with Ravan and his girlfriend, Aurora Brule. But Dufris is most memorable when depicting Aurora's father, Jack, who harbors haunting memories of WWII, memories that drive the book toward its satisfying conclusion. D.J.S.

Finally, two shorter pieces illuminate the bookends of a legendary career: &#x201c;The Day I Became a Professional&#x201d; &#x2015;which will appeal to any hopeful young artist&#x2015;describes Eisner&#x2019;s first rejection from a potential publisher, and &#x201c;A Sunset in Sunshine City&#x201d; provides a poignant portrait of Eisner in old age. The book features famous characters from the world of comics (under pseudonyms, of course) and other historical figures and family members, all drawn with Eisner&#x2019;s characteristic mastery and technique.</p><p>Born in New York City, Will Eisner (1917&#x2013;2005) was the author of the legendary comic strip The Spirit, as well as fifteen graphic novels and three influential instructional textbooks. The comic industry&#x2019;s top awards, the Eisner Awards, are named in his honor.In these rare examples of autobiographical work from comics master Eisner, we see the artist looking back on the expanse of his life. Shown are the New York of his childhood, a family that came together more out of necessity than love, the young artist at war and the ramifications of anti-Semitism at home and in Europe. In an enthusiastic introduction, Scott McCloud tells us, When you enter a 'graphic novels' section of a bookstore, you're looking at Will's handiwork. Indeed, the sense of witnessing history is strong. In The Dreamer, Eisner tells the story of his entry into and hand in creating the comics industry. This section is thinly veiled as fiction but a helpful annotation from the publisher makes clear what the real-world business corollaries were. The central piece of the book is To the Heart of the Storm, in which the artist rides a train through Europe on his way to the war and, as he looks out his window, sees scenes from the past. Eisner's childhood in the Bronx is played out, as are his parents' early lives. This is a rich story, and Eisner's expression of the difficulties faced by Jews in the early part of the 19th century reveals his gritty side. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The Fall of the Pagoda introduces a young girl (called Lute) growing up amid many family entanglements with her divorced mother and spinster aunt during the 1930s in Shanghai&#x2019;s International Settlement. Both novels shed light on the construction of selfhood in Chang&#x2019;s other novels, through lengthy discussions of Chang&#x2019;s difficult relationship with her selfishly demanding mother as well as of intricate dynamics in the extended families who emerged from aristocratic households of the late Qing Dynasty.

Analyses of dance movements or song lyrics is beyond the scope of this primer.

This book offers Weston masterpieces spanning more than four decades. Included are his early Pictorialist images, industrial studies of Armco Steel, portraits from his Mexican period, the still lifes and landscapes of the 1930s and the sometimes acerbic images of the later years. R.H. Cravens's essay draws upon Weston's writings and recollections by sons, lovers and friends.

It&#x2019;s so clear, quiet, and unchanging that it draws no attention. We can go an entire lifetime without noticing it. Yet, it is there. The Buddha called it "Awakening" or the "End of Suffering." He didn&#x2019;t talk about it but rather taught a way to cultivate the direct experience of it. This experience is what counts. Many contemporary schools of Buddhism have drifted away from the Buddha&#x2019;s original teachings over the centuries. Now, we can still find His elegant, nuanced, and efficient path. Buddha&#x2019;s Map is the tale of Doug Kraft&#x2019;s journey down this awakening path, his experience of spaces within himself he never thought possible. Easy to read yet an elegant combination of autobiography and instruction, Buddha&#x2019;s Map offers rare and intimate insight to the meditative states Buddhist monks are not allowed to discuss. With clear and direct advice, Kraft shares his belief in everyone&#x2019;s capacity to experience the ultimate in the original Buddhist meditation practice.

So in 1976 he signed up for a ten-day meditation retreat. It was difficult. When he left he thought, &#x201c;That may have been the most wonderful thing I've ever done, but I'm glad I'll never have to do it again.&#x201d; Nevertheless, he found himself sitting an hour and a half a day. And he went back for another retreat the next year. And the next. And the next.Over the years he trained with Theravadan Buddhists such as Larry Rosenberg, Corrado Pensa, Jack Kornfield, Joseph Goldstein, Sharon Salzberg, Christopher Titum, Joanna Macy, and Andy Olendski. He also trained with non-Theravadans including Korean Zen Master Sahn Seung, Tibetan Mingur Rinpoche, Siddha Yoga guru Muktananda, Ram Dass, Pir Vilat Khan, Salvador Rouchet, Emmanuel, and Jean Houston.Shortly after moving to California in 2000, he became a student of John Travis and traveled to Thailand to study with the Thai Forest master Ajahn Tong. With Travis's encouragement he trained with a jhana master, Bhante Vimalaramsi. In his first few years with Bhante, his practice progressed more quickly than in the previous twenty-five years.

Three days later, having barely avoided a British warship and a French naval vessel loyal to the Crown, the <em>L'Inconstant</em> traded the white flag of Elba for the French Tricolor as the rocky coast of the Cap d'Antibes came into view. With his return to French soil, accompanied only by a small force of one thousand men, Napoleon had set into motion the momentous events that would, over the next one hundred days, propel Europe once again into total war, ending only with the routing at Waterloo of the seemingly invincible Grande Armee, and Napoleon's final exile on St. Helena.<br> In <em>One Hundred Days</em>, Alan Schom offers us an epic tale of intrigue, high drama, and ultimate tragedy. By turns harrowing and exhilarating--and always charged with an undercurrent of impending doom--<em>One Hundred Days</em> is nothing less than the definitive account of Napoleon's final campaign, told with the characteristic panache of one of our premier narrative historians. Landing unopposed near Cannes, Napoleon and his tiny army began their march through a hostile countryside impoverished by years of war, famine, and conscription. But gradually, thanks mainly to the Emperor's legendary charisma, thousands of men joined his ranks, swelling the force to nearly 20,000 soldiers. By the time these impressive columns reached Paris, Louis XVIII had fled the city and only crowds and parades remained to greet Napoleon's seemingly inevitable return to power. But fate was against him this time: the allies, stunned by what appeared to be a remarkable reversal of fortune, were already on the move. All roads now led to Waterloo.<br> Besides being a lively and detailed look at Napoleon's final months as one of the most feared--and revered--men in Europe, <em>One Hundred Days</em> also offers vivid portraits of the many complex and fascinating personalities who surrounded him. Schom has mined a rich trove of little-known diaries, memoirs, military dispatches, and letters to allow this diverse cast of characters, whenever possible, to speak for themselves. He brings to life in compelling fashion all of Napoleon's generals, his enemies, his ministers, even the common soldiers who fought in the apocalyptic showdown in Belgium. And, of course, there is the omnipresent, titanic figure of Napoleon himself, readying the invasion, mustering troops, and, amid the frenzy and confusion of the final battle, coming to the agonizing realization that all was over. "We have taken Napoleon's hat," wrote Metternich to his daughter a few days after Waterloo, "It is to be hoped that we will now end in capturing the man himself." Within a month, the defeated Emperor was aboard the English frigate <em>Bellerophon</em> bound for exile, and thus dropped, in Marshal Ney's words, "the final curtain of the Napoleonade."<br> More than an account of one of the formative events in modern European history, this book adds a human dimension to a story that has, over the years, assumed mythic proportions.</p><p>Alan Schom doesn't think very highly of Napoleon, but he nevertheless has written an engrossing account of the little Corsican's escape from Elba, return to power, and defeat at Waterloo. (This period actually lasted a bit longer than 100 days, but who's counting?) Bonaparte, in Schom's view, was a despot who placed nepotistic interests ahead of national ones. He was plainly not good for the country he ruled, according to the author. But his military skills were exceptional, and he may have carried off a victory on the Belgian fields if his underlings hadn't bungled their duties. Schom breaks no new historical ground with <i>One Hundred Days</i>, but he tells his tale well.<br> <strong>Alan Schom</strong> is the author of <em>Trafalgar: Countdown to Battle, 1803-1805</em> and <em>Emile Zola: A Biography</em>.

At the strategic level, the focus is on understanding the needs of the business as a whole, its strategic direction, and identifying initiatives that will enable the business to meet its goals. At the tactical level, the discipline originally emerged from work previously done by project managers, such as gathering high level business requirements, and work done by systems analysts, such as designing functional requirements for software behavior. Business analysts are part strategist, part program or project manager, part architect and part systems analyst. They work as a liaison among stakeholders in order to elicit, analyze, and communicate requirements for changes to business processes, policies and information systems. Business analysts combine technical and communication skills to improve business by deciphering processes, making realistic, feasible recommendations and facilitating implementation of effective solutions.&nbsp;<br><br> Early works on business analysis suggest that use of specific diagrams, possessing a technical background or being a strong facilitator is what makes a successful business analyst. Seven Steps to Mastering Business Analysis&nbsp; advances the field by illustrating how all of these factors combined, along with many others, are the key to success. This book gives insight into the ideal skills and characteristics of successful business analysts and provides a foundation of learning for effecting business analysis work. This guide will also help prepare you for business analysis certification by explaining the tasks and knowledge areas in the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (BABOK).&nbsp; Seven Steps to Mastering Business Analysis will help build the skill sets of new and experienced analysts, and those currently doing analysis work including project managers, system analysts, product managers and business development professionals. Human resource professionals who are working to establish business analysis job descriptions and career paths in their organizations and executives who may have responsibility for managing and evaluating the success of business analysts will also find this book useful.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Barbara Carkenord, CBAP</b>, is President and co-founder of B2T Training, an organization that developed the first comprehensive business analysis training program in North America.

Those analysis techniques that most other books spend all of their space on are in here, but they are discussed only after looking at the needs of the stakeholders, the project, and the business and technical environment, as should be the case. If a solution isn't right for a business, it doesn't matter how well drawn the pictures are.

Without pretending to be able to foresee future developments, both authors of this book think it improbable that the problem will ever be solved, in the sense that we shall really understand this relation. We think that no more can be expected than to make a little progress here or there. We have written this book in the hope that we have been able to do so. We are conscious of the fact that what we have done is very conjectur� al and very modest. We are aware of our fallibility; yet we believe in the intrinsic value of every human effort to deepen our understanding of our� selves and of the world we live in. We believe in humanism: in human rationality, in human science, and in other human achievements, however fallible they are. We are unimpressed by the recurrent intellectual fashions that belittle science and the other great human achievements. An additional motive for writing this book is that we both feel that the debunking of man has gone far enough - even too far. It is said that we had to learn from Copernicus and Darwin that man&#39;s place in the universe is not so exalted or so exclusive as man once thought. That may well be.</p><p>The relation between body and mind is one of the oldest riddles that has puzzled mankind. That material and mental events may interact is accepted even by the law: our mental capacity to concentrate on the task can be seriously reduced by drugs. Physical and chemical processes may act upon the mind; and when we are writing a difficult letter, our mind acts upon our body and, through a chain of physical events, upon the mind of the recipient of the letter. the authors of this book stress that they cannot solve the body mind problem; but they hope that they have been able to shed new light on it.." . . anyone with an interest in philosophy, science, and the future of the world should read it."<br>-"British Journal of Psychiatry <br>." . . a massive achievement . . . a theory of beautiful simplicity, with all the relevant data clearly set out down to recent research findings."<br>-"The Jerusalem Post <br></p><h2>Getting Relationships Right: How to Build Resilience and Thrive in Life, Love, and Work</h2><p><b>Bestselling author, psychologist, and relationship coach Melanie Joy shares the principles and tools that can make any relationship, from personal to professional, healthier and more resilient.</b><br><br>Relationships are complicated. Yet it's an unfortunate reality that while most of us have to learn complex geometry that we'll probably never use, we don't get a single formal lesson in how to relate to others. In this one-stop guide, psychologist Melanie Joy reveals the common psychological dynamics that underlie all kinds of relationships--with a romantic partner, friends, family members, colleagues--in short, with anyone in any situation. Understanding these dynamics will help you make all your relationships healthier and more resilient. <br><br>Relationships are like bodies: they get sick when their immune system is weaker than the germs that stress them. Drawing on the most relevant research as well as on her own extensive experience as a psychologist, Joy explains how to strengthen your relational immune system to resist not only interpersonal stressors but also largely invisible yet potentially devastating societal stressors like racism and sexism. With this understanding, you can cultivate relationships that consistently reflect core moral values and honor the dignity of everyone involved. Resilient relationships are not only a source of joy and fulfillment for those who are in them, they also support the thriving of the organizations and communities of which we all are a part.</p><p><b>Melanie Joy</b>, PhD, EdM, is a Harvard-educated psychologist specializing in relationships, communication, and social change.

Through the hazardous years following the war he worked at many occupations: schoolteacher, small-town drama critic, race-car driver, editor of a sports magazine. His first novel, <i>All Quiet on the Western Front, </i>was published in Germany in 1928. A brilliant success, selling more than a million copies, it was the first of many literary triumphs. When the Nazis came to power, Remarque left Germany for Switzerland. He rejected all attempts to persuade him to return, and as a result he lost his German citizenship, his books were burned, and his films banned. He went to the United States in 1938 and became a citizen in 1947. He later lived in Switzerland with his second wife, the actress Paulette Goddard.

The climax of his trip is a reunion with his former housekeeper. The Remains of the Day won the prestigious Booker Prize for Fiction in 1989 and is also an acclaimed film starring Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson.</p><p>The novel&#39;s narrator, Stevens, is a perfect English butler who tries to give his narrow existence form and meaning through the self-effacing, almost mystical practice of his profession. In a career that spans the second World War, Stevens is oblivious of the real life that goes on around him -- oblivious, for instance, of the fact that his aristocrat employer is a Nazi sympathizer. Still, there are even larger matters at stake in this heartbreaking, pitch-perfect novel -- namely, Stevens&#39; own ability to allow some bit of life-affirming love into his tightly repressed existence.The Booker Prize-winning novel is now a film from Columbia Pictures starring Academy Award winners Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson.<br><br>The Remains of the Day is a profoundly compelling portrait of the perfect English butler and of his fading, insular world in postwar England.

But there is a natural and affordable alternative for managing these potentially deadly conditions, reducing your risk of heart failure, stroke, and kidney disease, and achieving the best health of your life: the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet. Developed by a world-class team of doctors and nutritionists, the DASH diet gives you:<br> <br> � Complete and balanced nutrition for safe short-term and long-term weight loss<br> <br> � A scientifically proven approach to managing diabetes and heart disease <i>without </i>prescription medication<br> <br> � A hearty and healthful selection of DASH menus, recipes, and grocery lists<br> <br> � DASH exercise programs for everyday living<br> <br> � Key tools including calorie worksheets and a formula to calculate body mass . . . and much more from this revolutionary program, which is recommended by the American Heart Association; the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; the American Society for Hypertension; and other leading medical authorities.</p><p><i>The DASH Diet for Hypertension</i>, recommended by the American Heart Association, has been shown in studies to lower blood pressure in two weeks without the use of drugs. The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy; includes moderate amounts of fish, poultry, and nuts; and reduces consumption of red meat and sweets. Studies from the National Institutes of Health followed 800 participants and found that the DASH diet lowered blood pressure as much as typical medication.<p> This is no quirky diet--it's the way the major medical groups have been advising us to eat all along, but with a specific formula that tells you how many servings to eat from each Food Pyramid food group. You also get suggestions for exercising moderately, losing weight, reducing salt, and food shopping.</p><p> Included are two weeks of daily menus and 62 recipes, with modified favorites like Macaroni and Cheese and Sweet and Sour Pork with Vegetables, plus innovative dishes such as Mango/Black Bean Salad with Grilled Shrimp and Sweet-Potato Chips (baked).

The most fundamental problem was the dominance of the tactical defensive, when defenders protected by fieldworks could deliver deadly fire from rifles and artillery against attackers advancing in close-ordered lines. The vulnerability of these offensive forces as they crossed the so-called "deadly ground" in front of defensive positions was even greater with the improvement of armaments after the Civil War. </p></p><p><p><b>Perry D.

But managers today are confronted with new challenges in what has become "fend for yourself" federalism. City executives must do more with less while at the same time figure out ways to harness the power of new technologies and react to a globalized world and economy. It is no wonder then that even great managers can fail at urban administration. To succeed, they must understand the nature of community values, the pitfalls of bureaucratic inertia, and the craft of leadership&#x2015;that is, the politics of urban management.<br><br>Morgan, England, and Pelissero offer a forward-looking account of this new urban management environment. In a comprehensive update, the authors have reorganized the book&#x2019;s structure to better fit the challenges facing today&#x2019;s cities, and make even greater use of systems theory as an analytic framework. Featuring discussions of the New Public Management model, the impacts of globalization, changes in service delivery, urban planning, economic development, and program evaluation, they discuss key productivity enhancements that emphasize results and accountability. The authors then focus on the impact of citizen participation, e-government, the events of 9/11, and intergovernmental relations as examples of significant environmental factors that impinge on the management of modern cities.

Akin, and Tony Merida, this new commentary series, projected to be 48 volumes, takes a Christ-centered approach to expositing each book of the Bible. Rather than a verse-by-verse approach, the authors have crafted chapters that explain and apply key passages in their assigned Bible books. Readers will learn to see Christ in all aspects of Scripture, and they will be encouraged by the devotional nature of each exposition. <i>Exalting Jesus in Mark</i> is written by Daniel L. Akin.<br></p><p><b>Daniel L. Akin</b> is the president of Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, North Carolina. He holds a Ph.D. in Humanities from the University of Texas at Arlington and is the author or editor of numerous books and Bible commentaries including <i>Theology for the Church</i> and the <i>New American Commentary on 1, 2, and 3 John</i>.<br>There are four things I know which are rock-solid certain. When Danny Akin sits at the keyboard to write a Bible commentary you can be sure it will be (1) as straight as an arrow theologically and doctrinally, (2) it will be bathed in prayer with a heart that beats to please Him above all things, (3) it will be culturally pertinent with a &#x2018;scarlet thread&#x2019; woven through every page pointing to Jesus, and (4) it will magnify the Lord Jesus and His call to take the gospel to every tongue and tribe and people on the planet.

Yet far too many sermons on texts from the Gospels fail to display the glories of Jesus as God, Savior, and King. In his very first verse, Mark reminds us that his Gospel and the gospel are all about Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Yet our arrogance breeds sacrilege, prompting us to make the Gospels more about us than about Him. Akin's book helps preachers 'get it right' by guiding them in giving Jesus his proper place in the exposition of the Gospel of Mark and reminding us that Christ should be the sacred obsession of every disciple in both the pulpit and the pew.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>Charles Quarles</b><br> Professor of New Testament and Theology, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary<br> &nbsp;<br><br> Confidence in the truth and power of God&#x2019;s written Word should prompt pastors and teachers not only to say worthy things about the Bible, but also to preach and teach with faithfulness&nbsp;<i>from</i>&nbsp;the Bible.&nbsp;The <i>Christ-Centered Exposition</i> series helps us to do just that.&nbsp;Theologically rock solid, this series is a clear, practical, and useful guide to the kind of biblical exposition that will please the Lord and build up his church.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>Timothy George</b><br> Founding dean of Beeson Divinity School of Samford University and general editor of the&nbsp;<i>Reformation Commentary on Scripture</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> There is nothing more helpful to a pastor than resources that are biblically faithful and pastorally applicable. &nbsp;The Christ-Centered Exposition series hits the bull&#x2019;s eye.

The pastoral focus, the preaching tools and the redemptive insights make this a series of immediate use and great aid to pastors who want to equip their people to serve the Lord in the joyous power of the gospel &#x2013; rather than in the vain pressures of servile dread or slavish fear.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>Bryan Chapell</b><br> President Emeritus, Covenant Seminary and Pastor, Grace Presbyterian Church<br> It's one thing to know Bible stories; it's another to know the story of the Bible. It's one thing to be aware of the story's many heroes; it's another to have met the Hero himself. From the Old Testament that anticipates him, to the Gospels that manifest him, to the Book of Acts that proclaims him, to the Epistles that explain him, and to the Book of Revelation that tells of him coming again, your Bible is about Jesus. That's why I love the vision of the <i>Christ-Centered Exposition Commentary</i> series.

applications. PHP is a powerful scripting language designed to enable developers to create highly featured Web applications quickly, and MySQL is a fast, reliable database that integrates well with PHP and is suited for dynamic Internet-based applications. "PHP and MySQL Web Development" shows how to use these tools together to produce effective, interactive Web applications. It clearly describes the basics of the PHP language, explains how to set up and work with a MySQL database, and then shows how to use PHP to interact with the database and the server. This practical, hands-on book includes numerous examples that demonstrate common tasks such as authenticating users, constructing a shopping cart, generating PDF documents and images dynamically, sending and managing email, facilitating user discussions, connecting to Web services using XML, and developing Web 2.0 applications with Ajax-based interactivity. The fourth edition of "PHP and MySQL Web Development" has been thoroughly updated, revised, and expanded to cover developments in PHP 5 through version 5.3, such as namespaces and closures, as well as features introduced in MySQL 5.1. <br><p> <b>Lead Authors</b> </p> <p> <b> <br> </b> </p> <p> <b>Laura Thomson </b>is a senior software engineer at Mozilla Corporation.

The author relates this discrepancy between performance and measured abilities to the educational problems of disadvantaged children. He presents his arguments simply and clearly, with sensitive and detailed descriptions and many excellent illustrations.

Price&#x2019;s Raid, the common name for the Missouri Campaign led by General Sterling Price, was the last of these attempts. Involving tens of thousands of armed men, the 1864 Missouri Campaign has too long remained unexamined by a book-length modern study but now, &nbsp;Civil War scholar Mark A. Lause fills this long-standing gap in the literature, providing keen insights on the problems encountered during and the myths propagated about this campaign. </p><p>General Sterling Price marched Confederate troops 1,500 miles into Missouri, five times as far as his Union counterparts who met him in the incursion. Along the way, he picked up additional troops; the most exaggerated estimates place Price&#x2019;s troop numbers at 15,000. The Federal forces initially underestimated the numbers heading for Missouri and then called in troops from Illinois and Kansas, amassing 65,000 to 75,000 troops and militia members. The Union tried to downplay its underestimation of the Confederate build-up of troops by supplanting the term "campaign" with the impromptu "raid." This term was also used by Confederates to minimize their lack of military success. The Confederates, believing that Missourians wanted liberation from Union forces, had planned a two-phase campaign. They intended not only to disrupt the functioning government through seizure of St. Louis and the capitol Jefferson City but also to restore the pro-secessionist government driven from the state three years before. The primary objective, however, was to change the outcome of the Federal elections that fall, encouraging votes against the Republicans who incorporated ending slavery into the Union war goals. What followed was widespread uncontrolled brutality in the form of guerrilla warfare, which drove support for the Federalists. Missouri joined Kansas in reelecting the Republicans and ensuring the end of slavery. </p><p>Lause&#x2019;s account of the Missouri Campaign of 1864 brings new understanding of the two distinct phases of the campaign, as based upon declared strategic goals. Additionally, as the author reveals the clear connection between the military campaign and the outcome of the election, he successfully tests the efforts of new military historians to integrate political, economic, social, and cultural history into the study of warfare. In showing how both sides during Sterling&#x2019;s Raid used self-serving fictions to provide a rationale for their politically motivated brutality and were unwilling to risk defeat, Lause reveals the underlying nature of the American Civil War as a modern war.</p></p><p>Mark A.

Factors affecting the performance of these biomaterials are presented, and precautionary measures to reduce premature, hydrolytic degradation during manufacturing and processing are discussed. Because of the structural requirements of medical devices and the technological advancements in synthetic fibers and textile technology, the new field of "Biotextiles" has evolved to exploit the potential of various woven, knitted, braided and non-woven textile structures for biomedical applications. Textile substrates provide certain unique mechanical properties to the medical device and because of an inherently high level of porosity, they can encourage cell growth and promote migration and proliferation. Bioresorbable devices that assist in the repair and regeneration of damaged tissues have in recent years replaced many of the permanent prosthetic devices. Thus, the topic of &#x201c;Bioresorbable Biomaterials&#x201d; generates much interest and research activity in the field of biomaterials science today. For this reason, the use of bioresorbable polymers as fibers is currently dominating the field of resorbable biomaterials for applications from sutures to tissue engineering scaffolds.</p><p></p><h2>Introduction to Abstract Algebra</h2><p><p><b>Praise for the Third Edition</b></p> <p><b>". . . an expository masterpiece of the highest didactic value that has gained additional attractivity through the various improvements . . ."&#x2015;Zentralblatt MATH</b></p> <p>The Fourth Edition of <i>Introduction to Abstract Algebra</i> continues to provide an accessible approach to the basic structures of abstract algebra: groups, rings, and fields.

Correcting this imbalance, <i>Making Knowledge in Early Modern Europe</i> brings together a wide-ranging yet tightly integrated series of essays that explore how knowledge was obtained and demonstrated in Europe during an intellectually explosive four centuries, when standard methods of inquiry took shape across several fields of intellectual pursuit.<br><br>Composed by scholars in disciplines ranging from the history of science to art history to religious studies, the pieces collected here look at the production and consumption of knowledge as a social process within many different communities. They focus, in particular, on how the methods employed by scientists and intellectuals came to interact with the practices of craftspeople and practitioners to create new ways of knowing. Examining the role of texts, reading habits, painting methods, and countless other forms of knowledge making, this volume brilliantly illuminates the myriad ways these processes affected and were affected by the period&#x2019;s monumental shifts in culture and learning.</p><p><b>Pamela H.

In this the original quest narrative, Jason leads a voyage of heroes, including his friend Hercules and many others, in his ship the Argo, to recapture the sacred Golden Fleece and bring it home.

The author critically evaluates the extant sources and offers a wealth of contextual information. The core of the book is formed by a close reading of the initiation ritual, including the burning of incense, the altar, the enactment of a journey of life and death, and the blood covenant. Different narrative structures are also presented. These include the messianic demonological paradigm, political legitimation, and the foundation of myth. Triad lore is placed in its own religious and cultural context, allowing radically new conclusions about its origins, meanings and functions.

Franzen brings an old-time America of freight trains and civic duty, of Cub Scouts and Christmas cookies and sexual inhibitions, into brilliant collision with the modern absurdities of brain science, home surveillance, hands-off parenting, do-it-yourself mental healthcare, and the anti-gravity New Economy. With <i>The Corrections</i>, Franzen emerges as one of our premier interpreters of American society and the American soul.</p><p>Enid Lambert is terribly, terribly anxious. Although she would never admit it to her neighbors or her three grown children, her husband, Alfred, is losing his grip on reality. Maybe it's the medication that Alfred takes for his Parkinson's disease, or maybe it's his negative attitude, but he spends his days brooding in the basement and committing shadowy, unspeakable acts. More and more often, he doesn't seem to understand a word Enid says.</p><p>Trouble is also brewing in the lives of Enid's children. Her older son, Gary, a banker in Philadelphia, has turned cruel and materialistic and is trying to force his parents out of their old house and into a tiny apartment. The middle child, Chip, has suddenly and for no good reason quit his exciting job as a professor at D------ College and moved to New York City, where he seems to be pursuing a "transgressive" lifestyle and writing some sort of screenplay. Meanwhile the baby of the family, Denise, has escaped her disastrous marriage only to pour her youth and beauty down the drain of an affair with a married man--or so Gary hints.</p><p>Enid, who loves to have fun, can still look forward to a final family Christmas and to the ten-day Nordic Pleasurelines Luxury Fall Color Cruise that she and Alfred are about to embark on. But even these few remaining joys are threatened by her husband's growing confusion and unsteadiness. As Alfred enters his final decline, the Lamberts must face the failures, secrets, and long-buried hurts that haunt them as a family if they are to make the corrections that each desperately needs.</p></p><p>Jonathan Franzen's exhilarating novel <i>The Corrections</i> tells a spellbinding story with sexy comic brio, and evokes a quirky family akin to Anne Tyler's, only bitter. Franzen's great at describing Christmas homecomings gone awry, cruise-ship follies, self-deluded academics, breast-obsessed screenwriters, stodgy old farts and edgy Tribeca bohemians equally at sea in their lives, and the mad, bad, dangerous worlds of the Internet boom and the fissioning post-Soviet East. <p> All five members of the Lambert family get their due, as everybody's lives swirl out of control. Paterfamilias Alfred is slipping into dementia, even as one of his inventions inspires a pharmaceutical giant to revolutionize treatment of his disease. His stubborn wife, Enid, specializes in denial; so do their kids, each in an idiosyncratic way. Their hepcat son, Chip, lost a college sinecure by seducing a student, and his new career as a screenwriter is in peril. Chip's sister, Denise, is a chic chef perpetually in hot water, romantically speaking; banker brother Gary wonders if his stifling marriage is driving him nuts. We inhabit these troubled minds in turn, sinking into sorrow punctuated by laughter, reveling in Franzen's satirical eye: </p><blockquote> Gary in recent years had observed, with plate tectonically cumulative anxiety, that population was continuing to flow out of the Midwest and toward the cooler coasts.... Gary wished that all further migration [could] be banned and all Midwesterners encouraged to revert to eating pasty foods and wearing dowdy clothes and playing board games, in order that a strategic national reserve of cluelessness might be maintained, a wilderness of taste which would enable people of privilege, like himself, to feel extremely civilized in perpetuity. </blockquote> Franzen is funny and on the money.

Like "ravine lot" and "parklike setting," "all brick" has a certain cachet for home buyers, and as buzzwords go, it probably carries more weight in Ontario than in, say, Calgary or Montreal, where brick construction was never so firmly entrenched in local building traditions. Indeed, Ontario is synonymous with brick and always has been. If you need more proof, just take the bridge across the international boundary from Sault Ste. Marie to the Soo in Michigan, from Fort Erie to Buffalo or from Prescott to Ogdensburg, New York. One of the first things an astute visitor will notice is the extent to which the American towns are dominated by frame houses and wood siding. Back home in Ontario, however, it's a different story, whether the dwellings are old or new.</p> <p>From day to day, we tend not to notice our predilection for brick houses, but we ought to acknowledge it for what it is: one of the most recognizable traits of Ontario's architectural legacy and something that distinguishes us from our neighbours. But it is not the only virtue specific to our vintage houses. Ontario even has its own homegrown signature style, once so common in our towns and countryside as to be ubiquitous but just as valid a hallmark as the saltbox in New England and the steep-roofed habitant homestead in Quebec. Our style has no official name but can easily be recognized by the symmetrical arrangement of doors and windows under a roof that stands only a storey and a half high. Over the front entrance is another identifying mark: a gable peak fitted with a Gothic-pointed window. Similar houses can be spotted from Massachusetts to Manitoba but never in the same numbers as in the corridor between Windsor and Cornwall and north into the Canadian Shield. Although the type has been around since the early days of settlement, only in recent years have we seemed to notice that this is something we can truly call our own. Perhaps the time has come to give it a proper name: the "Ontario farmhouse" style.</p> <p>Although easier to heat and more economical to build than a house a full two storeys high, the Ontario farmhouse owes its popularity more to politics than to pragmatism. Beginning in 1807, it was taxed at a significantly lower rate. At the same time, despite the ornament often lavished upon it, the gable was a purely practical amenity: It made the attic space more usable, providing extra headroom and much-needed light. Thus a provincial icon was born that would survive long after the tax was revoked in 1853. In fact, it was well after Confederation, when building fashion and technology embraced a new bigger-is-better ethic, that the classic Ontario farmhouse finally lost ground. Today, thousands of the genre survive in the heartland, a sampling of which are pictured on the pages that follow. As you study them, look for variations on the theme, especially the manner in which the front gable grew progressively steeper as the 19th century wore on.</p> <p>The storey-and-a-half farmhouse may be our signature tune, but old Ontario is rich in other architectural melodies, each a reflection of the times. Very few, however, are pure examples of their type, unsullied by outside influences. Rare was the builder who, embarking upon an Italianate-style house, for example, could resist tossing in a few Gothic touches here and there. Indeed, most Ontario houses are unabashedly eclectic. They owe their symmetry to the Georgian tradition, while their verandahs were inherited from the Regency style. Roof brackets and slender windows are Italianate, and Gothicism shows in pointed church-style windows. Another feature that marks Ontario architecture is its tendency toward conservatism. Even in the 20th century, the concept of "home" was more often expressed in the tried-and-true than in the avant-garde. Likewise, it was considered quite vulgar to display one's wealth with anything pretentious or overtly extravagant. But when you think about it, perhaps this isn't surprising. After all, the very first settlers in the province, the United Empire Loyalists, were by nature a conservative breed, aghast at the revolutionary ideals of the new United States. It could be argued that Loyalist values set the tone for generations to come.</p> <p>It is also no surprise to learn that Ontario houses, like the people themselves, were a blend of American and British influences, although builders were more likely to look to mother England for inspiration than south of the border. This would account for our preference for the British-born Regency and Gothic stylings, neither of which is as well represented in bordering states. And it also speaks volumes about why the Greek Revival, which swept the United States in the 1820s and 1830s, seldom took full flight in Ontario. It seems that its connections to democratic ideals and republican principles were just too much for monarchist Upper Canada. Indeed, suspicious eyebrows were often raised at any builder whose house displayed undue Yankee influence.</p> <p>It is sad to note that many of our older houses were lost in the battle with 20th-century progress. Some were lost to neglect, but many more -- in city and country alike -- were bulldozed to pave the way for development, especially in the Toronto-centred conurbation between Oshawa and Niagara Falls. Fortunately, public opinion is no longer indifferent to the fate of our architectural heritage, and there is a whole new generation of enthusiasts for whom restoring an old Ontario dwelling is the stuff of dreams. This book offers plenty of inspiration, as it divides the province along informal geographical lines and presents capsule portraits of some of our very best vintage houses. Presented here are quaint farmhouses and fashionable urban addresses from almost every corner of the province, textbook examples of architectural finesse as well as homespun vernacular style, rare houses of the late 18th century, plenty from the 19th and several that demonstrate the new directions of the early 20th. Some are museums, but most are privately owned and maintained. Some are ordinary, some are exceptional, but all are possessed of a certain timeless charm. And more than a few are brick.</p> <p><i>A Note on Nomenclature</i></p> <p>If you followed the news in the 1990s, you know that the municipalities of Ontario have been reorganized. The process actually started in the early 1970s, when regional government was introduced to replace the county system. The latest round of reorganization has been much more thorough: New megacities have been created, and many a town and township have been amalgamated, not always willingly. Along with the changes, some familiar places have literally been wiped off the map, but the old names linger in common parlance, and for the purposes of this book, they remain very much alive. In a work that highlights history, it seems only natural to refer to Norfolk County, the City of Trenton and Darlington Township, even though none of them officially exist as municipal entities anymore. Somehow, the new names -- the Region of Haldimand-Norfolk, the City of Quinte West and the Municipality of Clarington -- don't yet trip as lightly off the tongue.</p></p><h2>Connecting Math Concepts - Workbook Level E</h2><p>Connecting Math Concepts introduces ideas gradually and teaches students the connections between concepts.

It should not be forgotten that there are alternatives, both in the definition of crime, and in responses to it. <br><br><em>A Suitable Amount of Crime</em> looks at the great variations between countries over what are considered 'unwanted acts', how many are constructed as criminal and how many are punished. It explains the differences between eastern and western Europe, between the USA and the rest of the world.

He is a coauthor of <i>The LaTeX Graphics Companion, Second Edition</i>, and <i>The LaTeX Web Companion</i>.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebastian started life in classics, moved to archaeology, and thence to computing. During the 1980s he taught humanities and archaeological computing at Southampton University, where he also came across TeX. The infection grew strong, and he spent most of the 1990s in TeX-related matters, working latterly for Elsevier Science in production support and in LaTeX to SGML conversion. During that time he was heavily involved in the international and UK TeX Users Groups in many capacities, and worked on a variety of LaTeX packages, most notably hyperref. His allegiance today has largely moved to XML, in which capacity he is Oxford's representative on the Board of the Text Encoding Initiative, but he retains a soft spot for the funny backslash and curly bracket language.</p> <p> <b>Denis Roegel</b> is associate professor in computer science at the University of Nancy. He has been involved in LaTeX for the past 15 years and has a special interest in technical graphics.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denis discovered computers in the early 1980s, and after studying mathematics and physics, he earned an engineering degree from the �cole Sup�rieure d'�lectricit� and a Ph.D. in computer science from the Universit� Henri Poincar� in Nancy. He later was a postdoctoral fellow at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.</p> <p> <b>Herbert Vo�</b> is a teacher of mathematics, physics and computer science at a German high school and a lecturer at the Free University of Berlin.

His first experience with a computer was in 1970 with an IBM machine and Algol60. The first text-processing program he used, in 1982, was Wordstar on a microcomputer with an 8080 chip. From this time on, he also was heavily involved in programming for various projects with Turbo Pascal. He came back to PostScript and LaTeX at the end of the 90s.</p><p>More than a decade has passed since the publication of the first edition of <i>The LATEX Graphics Companion</i>, and there have been many changes and new developments since 1996.</p> <p>The second edition has seen a major change in the authorship: Frank, Michel and Sebastian have been joined by Denis and Herbert as authors, enriching the book with their knowledge and experience in individual subject areas.</p> <p>As in the first edition, this book describes techniques and tricks of extended LATEX typesetting in the area of graphics and fonts. We examine how to draw pictures with LATEX and how to incorporate graphics files into a LATEX document. We explain how to program pictures using METAFONT and METAPOST, as well as how to achieve special effects with small fragments of embedded PostScript. We look in detail at a whole range of tools for building graphics in TEX itself.</p> <p>TEX is the world's premi�re markup-based typesetting system, and PostScript (on which PDF is based) is the leading language for describing the printed page. We describe how they can produce evenmore beautiful resultswhen they work together. TEX's mathematical capability, its paragraph building, its hyphenation, and its programmable extensibility can cooperate with the graphical flexibility and font-handling capabilities of PostScript and PDF to provide a rich partnership for both author and typesetter.</p> <p>To be able to do justice to the graphics packages that have been further developed since the first edition, we decided to omit a description of PostScript and PDF tools, and of font technologies, from the printed version of this book. This material, which was covered in Chapters 10 and 11 of the first edition, has been substantially expanded and is now freely available (see http://xml.cern.ch/lgc2). It covers DVI-to-PostScript drivers, the free program ghostscript to view PostScript and PDF files, tools for manipulating PostScript and PDF files, and suggestions on how to combine the latest font technologies (PostScript Type 1 and OpenType) with LATEX.</p> <p>This volume is not a complete consumer guide to packages. In trying to teach by example, we present hundreds of self-contained code samples of the most useful types of solutions, based on proven and well-known implementations. But, given the space available, we cannot provide a full manual for every package. Our aim is simply to show how easy it is to use a given package and to indicate whether it seems to do what is required--not to dwell on the precise details of syntax or options. Nevertheless, we have described in more detail a few selected tools that we consider especially important.</p> <p>We assume you know some LATEX; you cannot read this book by itself if you have never used TEX before. We recommend that you start with <i>LATEX: A Document Preparation System, Second Edition</i> (Addison-Wesley, 1994), or the <i>Guide to LATEX, Fourth Edition</i> (Addison-Wesley, 2004), and continue with <i>The LATEX Companion, Second Edition</i> (Addison-Wesley, 2004), to explore some of the many (non-graphical) packages available.</p> <p><b>Why LATEX, and why PostScript?</b></p> <p>This book is about LATEX, graphics, PostScript, and its child PDF. We believe that the structured approach of a system like LATEX is the best way to use TEX, and LATEX is by far the most widely used TEX format. This means that it attracts contributors who develop new packages, and thus some of what we describe works only in LATEX. We apologize in advance for our LATEX bias to those who appreciate the elegance of the original plain TEX format and its derivatives, and we promise them that most of the packages will work well with any TEX dialect: the delights of systems such as METAPOST, PSTricks, XY-pic, and MusiXTEX are open to all.</p> <p>We also want to explain why we talk about PostScript so much. This language has been well established for almost two decades as an extremely flexible page-description language, and it remains the tool of choice for professional typesetters. Among the features that make it so attractive are these:</p> <ul> <li>The quantity, quality, and flexibility of Type 1 fonts</li> <li>The device-independence and portability of files</li> <li>The quality of graphics and the quantity of drawing packages that generate it</li> <li>The facilities for manipulating text</li> <li>The mature color-printing technology</li> <li>The encapsulation conventions that make it easy to embed PostScript graphics</li> <li>The availability of screen-based implementations (e.g., ghostscript/ghostview)</li> </ul> <p>PostScript has spawned an enterprising child, the PDF (Portable Document Format) language, used by Adobe Acrobat and now well established as an exchange format for documents on the Web. Designed for screen display with hypertext features, PDF offers a new degree of portability and efficiency. Although not the main subject of this book, we nevertheless mention that LATEX can also produce "rich" PDF documents, and versions of TEX (e.g., pdflatex) that produce PDF directly are available.</p> <p>Again, we apologize to those of you who are disappointed not to read about LATEX's association with Mac's QuickDraw, or the Windows GDI, HPGL, PCL, etc., but with so many packages available, we had to make a choice.</p> <p>Please note that the absence of a given package or tool in this book in no way implies that we consider it less useful or of inferior quality. We do think, though, that we have included a representative set of tools and packages, and we sincerely hope that you will find here one or more subjects to entertain you.</p> <p><b>How this book is arranged</b></p> <p>This book is subdivided in two basic ways: by application area and by technique. We suggest that all readers look at Chapter 1 before going any further, because it introduces how we think about graphics and summarizes some techniques developed in later chapters. We also suggest that you read Chapter 2, which covers the LATEX standard graphics package, since the tools for including graphics files will be needed often. Chapter 2 also covers pict2e, a package that reimplements LATEX's picture environment using PostScript, and a further extension curve2e. Together these packages not only do away with most of the limitations inherent in the standard version of LATEX's picture, but also offer new and powerful commands to draw arcs and curves with mininal effort.</p> <p>We have tried to make it possible to read each of the other chapters separately; you may prefer to go straight to the chapters that cover your subject area or look at those that describe a particular tool. Two chapters each are dedicated to the generic systems METAPOST and PSTricks.</p> <p> <b>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;METAFONT and METAPOST: TEX's Mates</b> shows how to exploit the power of TEX's META languages (Knuth's METAFONT and its PostScript-based extension METAPOST). After introducing the basic functions, the basic METAPOST libraries are described, as well as available TEX interfaces and miscellaneous tools and utilities.</p> <p> <b>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;METAPOST Applications</b> introduces the METAPOST toolkit, and explains how to use METAPOST's unparalleled expressive power for describing many types of graphs, diagrams, and geometric constructs. Applications in the areas of science and engineering, 3-D representations, posters, etc. conclude the overview.</p> <p> <b>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harnessing PostScript Inside LATEX: PSTricks</b> walks the reader through the various components of the PSTricks language, looking at such things as defining the coordinate system, lines and polygons, circles, ellipses and curves, arrows, labels, fill areas, and much more.</p> <p> <b>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Main PSTricks Packages</b> takes you even deeper into the world of PSTricks. Armed with the knowledge gained in Chapter 5, the reader will find here detailed descriptions of the most common PSTricks packages--in particular, pst-plot for plotting functions and data; pst-node formastering nodes and their connections; pst-tree for creating tree diagrams; pst-fill for filling and tiling areas; pst-3d for creating 3-Deffects, such as shadows and tilting; and pst-3dplot for handling 3-D functions and data sets. The chapter ends with a summary of PSTricks commands and keywords.</p> <p>The next four chapters discuss problems in special application areas and survey more packages:</p> <p> <b>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The XY-pic Package</b> introduces a package that goes to great lengths to define a notation for many kinds of mathematics diagrams and implements it in a generic and portable way.</p> <p> <b>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications in Science, Technology, and Medicine</b> looks at chemical formulae and bonds, applications in bioinformatics, Feynman diagrams, timing diagrams, and electronic and optics circuits.</p> <p> <b>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparing Music Scores</b> first describes the principles of the powerful MusiXTEX package. Then several preprocessors providing a more convenient interface are introduced: abc for folk tunes, PMX for entering polyphonic music, and M-Tx (an offspring of PMX) for dealing with multi-voice lyrics in scores. We also take a short look at LilyPond, a modern music typesetter written in C++, and say a few words about TEXmuse.</p> <p> <b>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Playing Games</b> is for those who use LATEX for play as well as for work. It shows you how to describe chess games and typeset chess boards (the usual and oriental variants). This chapter also describes how to handle Go, backgammon, and card games. We conclude with crosswords in various forms and Sudokus, including how to typeset, solve, and generate them.</p> <p>Our last chapter addresses an area of general interest: color, and some of its common uses in LATEX.</p> <p> <b>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World of Color</b> starts with a short general introduction to color. Next comes an overview of the xcolor package and the colortbl package, that is based on xcolor. The final part discusses the beamer class for producing color slides with LATEX.</p> <p>Appendix A describes ways to generate PDF from LATEX. Appendix B introduces CTAN and explains how to download the LATEX packages described in this book.</p> <p>As mentioned earlier, material about PostScript and PDF tools, as well as information about how to use PostScript and OpenType fonts with LATEX, is available as supplementary material (see http://xml.cern.ch/lgc2),which covers the following subjects: </p> <p> <b>PostScript Fonts and Beyond</b> describes the ins and outs of using PostScript fonts with LATEX. It also looks at the latest developments on how to integrate OpenType fonts by creating TEX-specific auxiliary files (TEX metrics, virtual fonts, etc.) or by reading the font's characteristics directly in the OpenType source.</p> <p> <b>PostScript and PDF Tools</b> starts with a short introduction to the PostScript, PDF, and SVG languages. It then describes some freely available programs, in particular dvips and pdflatex to generate PostScript and PDF, ghostscript and ghostview to manipulate and view PostScript and PDF, plus a set of other tools that facilitate handling PostScript and PDF files and conversions.</p> <p><b>Finding all those packages and programs</b></p> <p>All of the packages and programs described in this book are freely available in public software archives; a few are in the public domain, but most are protected by copyright and available to you under an open-source license. Some programs are available only in source form or work only on certain computer platforms, and you should be prepared for a certain amount of "getting your hands dirty" in some cases. We also cannot guarantee that later versions of packages or programs will give results identical to those in our book. Many of these packages and programs remain under active development, and new or changed versions appear several times a year; we completed this book in spring 2007, and tested the examples with the versions current at that time.</p> <p>In Appendix B we give full details on how to access CTAN sites and how to download files using the Internet. You can also purchase the TEX Collection DVD from one of the TEX Users Groups. This DVD contains implementations of TEX for various systems, many packages and fonts, in particular it provides you with all the LATEX packages described in this book and <i>The LATEX Companion, Second Edition</i>.

The straightforward transfer of SE to the broader situations of management was not possible, but by insisting on a combination of systems thinking strongly linked to real-world practice Checkland and his collaborators developed an alternative approach - Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) - which enables managers of all kinds and at any level to deal with the subtleties and confusions of the situations they face. This work established the now accepted distinction between &#39;hard&#39; systems thinking, in which parts of the world are taken to be &#39;systems&#39; which can be &#39;engineered&#39;, and &#39;soft&#39; systems thinking in which the focus is on making sure the process of inquiry into real-world complexity is itself a system for learning. Systems Thinking, Systems Practice (1981) and Soft Systems Methodology in Action (1990) together with an earlier paper Towards a Systems-based Methodology for Real-World Problem Solving (1972) have long been recognized as classics in the field. Now Peter Checkland has looked back over the three decades of SSM development, brought the account of it up to date, and reflected on the whole evolutionary process which has produced a mature SSM.

Emma, a matchmaker at heart, is obsessed with love and romance--for others. As for her own love life, she wants nothing of it. She even feels repulsed by the amorous declarations she receives. But as her matchmaking schemes go awry, and her friend Harriet shares her feelings toward a certain friend, Mr. Knightley, Emma soon becomes aware of her own heart&#x2019;s longings. <br> <br>&nbsp;<br> <br>* This beautiful book comes with luxurious endpapers, a beautiful and stylish heat-burnished cover, and is a convenient 5 x 7 trim size for easy handling.<br> <br>* The classic has sold millions of copies since its first publication.<br> <br>&nbsp;<br> <br><i>Emma</i> has been one of the most charming coming-of-age love stories for nearly two centuries. <br> <br>&nbsp;<br><br>About the Word Cloud Classics series:<br><br>Classic works of literature with a clean, modern aesthetic! Perfect for both old and new literature fans, the Word Cloud&nbsp;Classics series from Canterbury Classics provides a chic and inexpensive introduction to timeless tales. With a higher production value, including heat burnished covers and foil stamping, these eye-catching, easy-to-hold editions are the perfect gift for students and fans of literature everywhere.</p><p>Of all Jane Austen's heroines, Emma Woodhouse is the most flawed, the most infuriating, and, in the end, the most endearing. <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>'s Lizzie Bennet has more wit and sparkle; Catherine Morland in <i> Northanger Abbey</i> more imagination; and <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>'s Elinor Dashwood certainly more sense--but Emma is lovable precisely because she is so imperfect. Austen only completed six novels in her lifetime, of which five feature young women whose chances for making a good marriage depend greatly on financial issues, and whose prospects if they fail are rather grim. <i>Emma</i> is the exception: "Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her." One may be tempted to wonder what Austen could possibly find to say about so fortunate a character. The answer is, quite a lot. <p> For Emma, raised to think well of herself, has <i>such</i> a high opinion of her own worth that it blinds her to the opinions of others. The story revolves around a comedy of errors: Emma befriends Harriet Smith, a young woman of unknown parentage, and attempts to remake her in her own image. Ignoring the gaping difference in their respective fortunes and stations in life, Emma convinces herself and her friend that Harriet should look as high as Emma herself might for a husband--and she zeroes in on an ambitious vicar as the perfect match. At the same time, she reads too much into a flirtation with Frank Churchill, the newly arrived son of family friends, <i>and</i> thoughtlessly starts a rumor about poor but beautiful Jane Fairfax, the beloved niece of two genteelly impoverished elderly ladies in the village. As Emma's fantastically misguided schemes threaten to surge out of control, the voice of reason is provided by Mr. Knightly, the Woodhouse's longtime friend and neighbor. Though Austen herself described Emma as "a heroine whom no one but myself will much like," she endowed her creation with enough charm to see her through her most egregious behavior, and the saving grace of being able to learn from her mistakes. By the end of the novel Harriet, Frank, and Jane are all properly accounted for, Emma is wiser (though certainly not sadder), and the reader has had the satisfaction of enjoying Jane Austen at the height of her powers. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Emma is Austen&#39;s most technically accomplished novel, with a hidden plot, the full implications of which are only revealed by a second reading. The text presented here retains the spelling and punctuation of the first edition of 1816, allowing readers to see the novel as Austen&#39;s contemporaries first encountered it. The volume provides comprehensive explanatory notes, an extensive critical introduction, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and an authoritative textual apparatus. This edition is an indispensable resource for all scholars and readers of Austen.</p><h2>Gifts of Age: Portraits and Essays of 32 Remarkable Women</h2><p>Writer Charlotte Painter and artist/photographer Pamela Valois have combined their impressive talents to present these intimate glimpses into the lives of thirty-two remarkable women, each of whom has discovered in maturity the opportunity of exploring new and exciting challenges. These are the <i>Gifts of Age:</i> the time, the freedom, and hopefully the wisdom to develop creative new images of oneself and one's place in the complexities of a long life. All of the women in this book are more than sixty-five years of age, and included are such well-known personalities as Julia Child, M.F.K. Fisher, Joan Baez Senior, and Louise M. Davies. No two have followed the same path, but each has been successful in achieving some new, frequently unanticipated distinction in her latter years. <i>Gifts of Age</i> is a fascinating insight into just how productive one's extended life can be, and inspiration for anyone who believes that the creative talent for living need not diminish with the passage of years.</p><p>Pamela Valois lives in Berkeley, California with her husband and two sons. Her photographs have been shown in West Coast galleries and have appeared nationally in books, magazines, and calendars.This is a beautiful (and successful) effort by photographer Valois and writer Painter to praise, through portrait and vignette, the lives of a group of older women, some well known, some not. Eloquently presented is the concept that "old" age for these women has not by any means brought an abandonment of vitality, commitment, and sense of purpose. Indeed, for many, an intensification and expansion of these attributes has occurred. Although these are particular women, they are clearly representative of the strength of the human will to "survive," with integrity, for the duration of one's life span. Visually attractive in format and content, stimulating of thought, this book should be savored. Highly recommended to a broad audience. Suzanne W. Wood, SUNY Agricultural &amp; Technical Coll.

Haitian Creole presents a comprehensive view of the structure and development of Haitian Creole. It provides a detailed analysis of the phonology and grammar of the language and points out key differences between these two fundamental aspects of the language and corresponding features of French, its original target language. The book contains a detailed description of the productive strategies of vocabulary development and deals with the origin of Haitian Creole, as well as its relationship to the other French-based creoles in Louisiana, the Caribbean, French Guiana, and the Indian Ocean. A signal innovation with regard to other descriptions of the language is the treatment of linguistic variation, both in geographical dialects and variation as determined by social factors, as well as the presentation of earlier forms of Haitian Creole, as attested by texts from the Colonial period. Another major contribution is the discussion of language planning and related issues concerning the use of Haitian Creole in education and its status relative to French, the other officially recognized language of Haiti.</p><p>Albert Valdman is director of the Creole Institute at Indiana University and is a leading international specialist of French-based creoles.

It offers a successful summary for those familiar with the subject, a successful introduction to the subject for those not (yet) familiar with it, and a reading that is highly recommendable despite its volume.&#34; --Zeitschrift fur franzosische Sprache und Literatur &#34;The generally very complete and detailed description of Haitian Creole will make this book a reference work in which one is likely to find information also on phenomena that other publications exclude for being peripheral.

Genius technician and colorist, master at capturing detail as well as "the sublime," successful showman, adventurer, and accomplished amateur architect, Church ranks as one of the leading figures in 19th-century American art. Kelly and Ryan have written outstanding essays on the artist's career and the creation of "Olana," his Persian-inspired home. In one fascinating and unusual offering, Gould explores Church's scientific "world view" and considers how it was profoundly challenged by Darwin's writings. The nearly 50 glorious color plates are supplemented by over twice as many color and black-and-white illustrations. Useful appendixes include an unfinished but annotated biography of Church by a close friend, an exhibition checklist, and a chronology. The catalog is a blockbuster, reminiscent of one of Church's monumental paintings and worthy of emulation in its thorough and somewhat unconventional approach.

After ten years of travel, Odysseus finally reaches Ithaca to find his family in turmoil. The saga of his efforts to make things right is one of the oldest works of Western literature, and still offers powerful lessons for modern times.</p><p>Robert Fagles's translation is a jaw-droppingly beautiful rendering of Homer's <i>Odyssey</i>, the most accessible and enthralling epic of classical Greece. Fagles captures the rapid and direct language of the original Greek, while telling the story of Odysseus in lyrics that ring with a clear, energetic voice. The story itself has never seemed more dynamic, the action more compelling, nor the descriptions so brilliant in detail. It is often said that every age demands its own translation of the classics. Fagles's work is a triumph because he has not merely provided a contemporary version of Homer's classic poem, but has located the right language for the timeless character of this great tale. Fagles brings the <i>Odyssey</i> so near, one wonders if the Hollywood adaption can be far behind. This is a terrific book.Homer is a legendary ancient Greek poet, traditionally said to be the author of the two great epics of Greek history: the Iliad and the Odyssey. Both books are considered landmarks in human literature, and Homer is therefore often cited as the starting point of Western literary and historical tradition.</p><h2>Intimate Relationships</h2><p>The fourth edition of this trusted text preserves the personal appeal of the subject matter and vigorous standards of scholarship that made the earlier editions so successful.

The abiding interest of artists in ruination and decay has led in particular to the concept of the modern ruin&#x2015;an ambiguous site of artistic and architectural modernism, personal and collective memories, and the cultural afterlife of eras such as those of state communism and colonialism. Contemporary art's explorations of the ruin can evoke on the one hand diverse experiences of nostalgia and on the other a ceaselessly renewed encounter with catastrophes of the recent past and apprehensions of the future. For every relic of a harmonious era or utopian dream stands another recalling industrial decline, environmental disaster, and the depredations of war.</p><p>This anthology provides a comprehensive survey of the contemporary ruin in cultural discourse, aesthetics, and artistic practice. It examines the development of ruin aesthetics from the early modern era to the present; the ruin as a privileged emblem of modernity's decline; the relic as a portal onto the political history of the recent past; the destruction and decline of cities and landscapes, with the emergence of &#x201c;non-places&#x201d; and &#x201c;drosscape&#x201d;; the symbolism of the entropic and decayed in critical environmentalism; and the confusing temporalities of the ruin in recent art&#x2015;its involution of timescales and perspectives as it addresses not just the past but the future.</p></p><p>Brian Dillon is the UK editor of <i>Cabinet</i> and the author of <i>In the Dark Room</i>, <i>Sanctuary</i>, and <i>The Hypochondriacs</i>.

Ranging from abstract theoretical reflection to pointed methodological critique, Abbott demonstrates the inevitably theoretical character of any methodology.<br><br><i>Time Matters</i> focuses particularly on questions of time, events, and causality. Abbott grounds each essay in straightforward examinations of actual social scientific analyses. Throughout, he demonstrates the crucial assumptions we make about causes and events, about actors and interaction and about time and meaning every time we employ methods of social analysis, whether in academic disciplines, market research, public opinion polling, or even evaluation research.

Incorporating theory, research, and the most recent available data, the book takes a contemporary and issues-oriented approach as it explores the most interesting and progressive developments in correctional policy and practice. Students will come away with practical knowledge, as well as a framework for thoughtful analysis of a subject that can seem mysterious or impenetrable. In addition, the book covers subjects many corrections texts treat only minimally, including women in corrections, the death penalty, and special populations.

Biographical events are adroitly placed within the broader historical canvas of colonization, decolonization, communism, war, and nation building.

In a gauntlet-throwing essay at the start of this brilliant assemblage, Cynthia Ozick stakes the claim that, just as surely as critics require a steady supply of new fiction, novelists need great critics to build a vibrant community on the foundation of literary history. For decades, Ozick herself has been one of our great critics, as these essays so clearly display. She offers models of critical analysis of writers from the mid-twentieth century to today, from Saul Bellow, Bernard Malamud, and Kafka, to William Gass and Martin Amis, all assembled in provocatively named groups: Fanatics, Monsters, Figures, and others. Uncompromising and brimming with insight, these essays are essential reading for anyone facing the future of literature in the digital age.</p><p>Author of numerous acclaimed works of fiction and nonfiction, CYNTHIA OZICK has received the National Book Critics Circle Award and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, and the Man Booker International Prize. Her writing has appeared in the<i> New Republic,</i><i>Harper's,</i> and elsewhere.Cynthia Ozick is one of the sharpest and most distinguished critics in American letters. For decades, her extraordinary readerly sensitivity and deep well of knowledge have informed penetrating judgments that delight and spark debate. Assembling ten years&#x2019; worth of Ozick&#x2019;s nonfiction writing in one volume, <i>Critics, Monsters, Fanatics, and Other Literary Essays</i> is both an exemplar of brilliant criticism and a powerful argument for the vitally important role of the critic, as much now as ever.<br><br> With the gauntlet-throwing essay that opens this book, Ozick contends that if literary fiction is to thrive in a culture awash in uncertainty and disruption, we need true critics to make sense of the present, illuminate the past, and point the way forward. The essays that follow reveal Ozick in peak form as she examines writers from the early twentieth century to today. Saul Bellow is here, and Bernard Malamud; Auden and Kafka; William Gass, Martin Amis, and more&#x2014;all gathered in provocatively named groups with new introductions: Figures, Fanatics, Monsters, Souls. Uncompromising and brimming with insight, these essays are marvels of elegant prose and discerning intellect from one of our most treasured writers.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Seven Faces of Philanthropy: A New Approach to Cultivating Major Donors</h2><p>Available for the first time in paperback, <i>Seven Faces of Philanthropy</i> introduces to you the Seven Faces approach&#x2014;a powerful tool that enables development professionals to maximize their effectiveness when approaching major donors for gifts.

Using this framework, the authors identify and profile seven types of major donors and offer detailed strategies on how to approach them. The seven types&#x2014;the Communitarian, the Devout, the Investor, the Socialite, the Altruist, the Repayer, and the Dynast&#x2014;emerged from a detailed, comprehensive study of wealthy donors. The authors explain why each type requires a different strategy when approached for gifts, and show how fundraising professionals can identify and understand the motivations of each type of donor and so build successful and sustaining relationships with major donors. The authors then show how to act on this knowledge, providing a coherent, step-by-step system to implement the Seven Faces framework. Through numerous detailed examples, they illustrate how to: <ul> <li>attract prospective donors</li> <li>motivate the donor to support a cause</li> <li>position the giving strategy, and</li> <li>ultimately empower the philanthropist.</li> </ul> The Seven Faces of Philanthropy approach can be used in the context of capital campaigns, major gift solicitations, and planned giving programs. Both novice and expert fundraisers will find this framework to be a valuable supplement to their existing strategies and techniques.</p><h2>Henry James: Daisy Miller * Washington Square * Portrait of a Lady * The Bostonians * The Aspern Papers</h2><p>Henry James looked at his society-its rules and foibles-with a sharp, unsparing eye.

The Selected Stories of Winifred Holtby (Virago Modern Classics)</h2><p>Irreverent and entertaining, these gems promise to be just what their author hoped&#x2014;"easy to pick up and more tantalizing for one's bedside than a novel." The passions and convictions that drove Winifred Holtby come to life in <i>Remember, Remember!,</i> which brings together for the first time stories from the collections <i>Truth is Not Sober</i> and <i>The Pavements of Anderby,</i> as well as a selection of previously unpublished tales. Many are autobiographical and feature the beloved Yorkshire farming community of her childhood.</p><p>Winifred Holtby (1898-1935) was born in Yorkshire. In the First World War she joined the Women&#39;s Auxiliary Army Corps and then went to Oxford where she became a great friend of Vera Brittain. SOUTH RIDING, her most famous novel, was published posthumously.Short stories may be the answer for people who don't want to get involved with complicated plots while driving. The author of these stories, who died at 37, hoped they would be "tantalizing"; she has had her wish fulfilled in this reading by Susan Jameson. Her voice melts into every story, setting the scene with a particular accent or a distinctive image as she presents humanity in each character. Having been written in another era, this material might be dated; however, Jameson brings new insights to the author's intuitions.

Given the pace of technological advances, it is inevitable that realistic robots specifically designed for people's sexual gratification will be developed in the not-too-distant future. Despite popular culture's fascination with the topic, and the emergence of the much-publicized Campaign Against Sex Robots, there has been little academic research on the social, philosophical, moral, and legal implications of robot sex. This book fills the gap, offering perspectives from philosophy, psychology, religious studies, economics, and law on the possible future of robot-human sexual relationships. </p><p>Contributors discuss what a sex robot is, if they exist, why we should take the issue seriously, and what it means to &#x201c;have sex&#x201d; with a robot. They make the case for developing sex robots, arguing for their beneficial nature, and the case against it, on religious and moral grounds; they consider the subject from the robot's perspective, addressing such issues as consent and agency; and they ask whether it is possible for a human to form a mutually satisfying, loving relationship with a robot. Finally, they speculate about the future of human-robot sexual interaction, considering the social acceptability of sex robots and the possible effect on society.</p><p><b>Contributors <br></b>Marina&nbsp;Adshade, Thomas Arnold, Julie Carpenter, John Danaher, Brian Earp, Lily Eva Frank, Joshua Goldstein, Michael Hauskeller, Noreen Herzfeld, Neil McArthur, Mark&nbsp;Migotti,&nbsp;Sven Nyholm, Ezio di Nucci, Steve Petersen, Anders Sandberg, Matthias Scheutz, Litska Strikwerda, Nicole&nbsp;Wyatt</p></p><p>John Danaher is a Lecturer in the Law School at the National University of Ireland, Galway, and the author of the popular blog Philosophical Disquisitions.</p><h2>Macroeconomics</h2><p><p><strong>Teaches students how macroeconomics is studied and applied in the 21st century.</strong></p><em>Macroeconomics</em> is the first text to truly reflect today&#x2019;s macroeconomy.

Now, in the new paperback edition of <em>Religion in American Life</em>, three of the country's most eminent historians of religion offer a superb overview that spans four centuries, illuminating the rich spiritual heritage central to nearly every event in our nation's history. <br> Jon Butler begins by describing the state of religious affairs in both the Old and New Worlds on the eve of colonization. He traces the progress of religion in the colonies through the time of the American Revolution, covering all the religious groups, Protestants, Jews, and Catholics, as well as the unique religious experiences of Native Americans and African Americans. Grant Wacker continues the story with a fascinating look at the ever-shifting religious landscape of 19th-century America. He focuses on the rapid growth of evangelical Protestants--Methodists, Presbyterians, Baptists, and others--and their competition for dominance over religions such as Catholicism and Judaism, which continued to increase with large immigrant arrivals from Ireland, Eastern Europe, and other countries. The 20th century saw massive cultural changes. Randall Balmer discusses the effects industrialization, modernization, and secularization had on new and established religions. He examines Protestants, Hindus, Jews, Muslims, New Age believers, Mormons, Buddhists, Roman Catholics, and many more, providing a clear look into the kaleidoscope of religious belief in modern-day America. <br> <em>Religion in American Life</em> is an engrossing look at how religion has changed--and in turn been changed by--the extraordinary events throughout American history.</p><p><br><strong>Jon Butler</strong> is Howard R.

The passengers subsequently sought safe haven in the United States, but were rejected once again, and the St. Louis had to embark on an uncertain return voyage to Europe. Finally, the St. Louis passengers found refuge in four western European countries, but only the 288 passengers sent to England evaded the Nazi grip that closed upon continental Europe a year later. Over the years, the fateful voyage of the St. Louis has come to symbolize U.S. indifference to the plight of European Jewry on the eve of World War II.&nbsp;<br><br>Although the episode of the St. Louis is well known, the actual fates of the passengers, once they disembarked, slipped into historical obscurity. Prompted by a former passenger&#x2019;s curiosity, Sarah Ogilvie and Scott Miller of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum set out in 1996 to discover what happened to each of the 937 passengers. Their investigation, spanning nine years and half the globe, took them to unexpected places and produced surprising results. <i>Refuge Denied</i> chronicles the unraveling of the mystery, from Los Angeles to Havana and from New York to Jerusalem.&nbsp;<br><br>Some of the most memorable stories include the fate of a young toolmaker who survived initial selection at Auschwitz because his glasses had gone flying moments before and a Jewish child whose apprenticeship with a baker in wartime France later translated into the establishment of a successful business in the United States. Unfolding like a compelling detective thriller, <i>Refuge Denied</i> is a must-read for anyone interested in the Holocaust and its impact on the lives of ordinary people.</p><p>Sarah Ogilvie is director of the National Institute of Holocaust Education at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.<br> Scott Miller is director of the Benjamin and Vladka Meed Registry of Jewish Holocaust Survivors at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.The doomed ship <i>St. Louis&#x2014;</i>carrying German-Jewish refugees and refused permission to dock in Cuba and Florida in 1939&#x2014;became a potent symbol of global indifference to the fate of European Jewry on the eve of the Holocaust. While 288 of the more than 900 passengers found sanctuary in Great Britain, 620 were forced to return to mainland Europe, and close to half of those passengers sent to Belgium, France and Holland were murdered during the Holocaust. Among the survivors, a Miami-area retired baker and Korean War veteran, Herbert Karliner, got through WWII posing as a Catholic and working as a hired hand for a pro-Vichy farmer near Lyon. Another, Hannelore Klein, who in her 70s confesses to still feeling like a displaced person, was 12 when she was sent to Holland, survived Auschwitz (her mother was gassed) and returned to Amsterdam to live with her grandparents, Theresienstadt survivors. Prodigiously researched and generously illustrated with photographs&#x2014;most from the<i> St. Louis </i>and the Westerbork internment camp&#x2014;this valuable contribution to Holocaust studies provides emotionally satisfying closure as the authors, staffers at D.C.'s U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, track the passengers and give a human face to mass tragedy. <i>(Oct. 20)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But, as <em>God's Own Party </em>demonstrates, they shouldn't have been. The Christian Right goes back much farther than most journalists, political scientists, and historians realize. Relying on extensive archival and primary source research, Daniel K.

The author s engaging style brings the American political experience to life with clarity and vision, immersing readers into the politics surrounding eleven great crises in our nation s history. Through the eyes of philosophers, writers, and orators of each period and the voices of commentators both historical and current, political theories are outlined in the context of the debates and conversations of the men and women who have struggled to extricate the nation from crisis. New to the fourth edition are an analysis of the impact of Barack Obama on contemporary American political discourse, recent developments in the war on terror, and a section on gay and lesbian protest. A new chapter has been added that discusses the phenomenon of globalization and its challenge to American exceptionalism. As in previous editions, each chapter ends with an insightful author commentary and contains an up-to-date and comprehensive bibliographical essay, along with a list of major works for each period.

Tour.</p><p><b>Taylor Hartman</b> is a practicing psychologist and business leadership coach. He lives with his wife and family in Sandy, Utah.<p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> <b>Four Paths for Life</b> </p><p> <i>What you are is God's gift to you;<br> what you become is your gift to God.</i> </p><p> There are four clearly defined paths you can choose to walk in life. Your choices include (from most worthwhile to most detrimental): 1) <i>charactered,</i> 2) <i>healthy,</i> 3) <i>unhealthy,</i> 4) <i>pathological.</i> </p><p> Here's how they are broken down: </p><p> <b>Charactered</b> positive traits of colors from outside innate core personality<br> <b>Healthy</b> positive traits of color from inside innate core personality<br> <b>Unhealthy</b> negative traits of color from inside innate core personality<br> <b>Pathological</b> negative traits of colors from outside innate core personality </p><p> THE CHARACTERED PATH </p><p> Only quality individuals choose the charactered path. The other three paths will offer a more limited version of life. Charactered people accurately identify and develop the strengths of their core personalities. Furthermore, they stretch to embrace the strengths of other personalities in order to compensate for their innate limitations. Embracing the gifts (strengths) of other colors, charactered people evolve. The more gifts they adopt, the more charactered they become, and the higher they soar in flight. </p><p> THE HEALTHY PATH </p><p> Healthy individuals are like a caterpillar in its cocoon, almost ready to take flight. Healthy individuals primarily engage life through their strengths. They provide wonderful role models for quality living as seen through the eyes of their particular personality. However, they remain primarily confined to expressing themselves through the strengths of their core color, limiting themselves only to those gifts championed by their particular personality. Expecting them to express the gifts in terms of other colors is often disappointing. </p><p> THE UNHEALTHY PATH </p><p> Unhealthy individuals begrudgingly remain caterpillars. Strapped by their innate "baggage," they spend their lives confined to and defined by their personality's limitations. Unlike pathological people, however, they remain true to the limitations within their core personality, expressing themselves consistently with their weaknesses. They usually become manipulative in order to justify and rationalize their limited (and often pathetic) lives. </p><p> THE PATHOLOGICAL PATH </p><p> Pathological individuals are severely handicapped human beings. In the context of this book, they would most likely even deny their existence as caterpillars. "Don't label me!" they demand. "I'm <i>all</i> the colors, depending on the circumstances. I'm a rainbow!" <b><i>Pathological people are completely out of touch with who they were innately born to be, and haven't a clue as to what they are capable of becoming.</i></b> </p><p> They express themselves throughout life in the limitations of all colors except their own. They are inconsistent and untrustworthy. While some are extremely intelligent, their lack of congruence creates a lack of clarity in their thought and behavior in all colors except their own. If you could see into the heart of these individuals, you would find serious confusion, powerlessness, and insecurity. They are often incapable of using their natural strengths and yet, ironically, refuse to live within their core personality limitations either. </p><p> CHOOSE YOUR PATH </p><p> Everybody must choose his/her destiny. The level of health you aspire to will ultimately determine the quality of your life. While there are great latitudes within each level, from charactered to pathological, each level has certain requirements: less healthy individuals typically place greater emphasis on themselves, and most often at the expense of others. </p><p> For example, all individuals who walk the charactered path learn and embrace gifts other personalities bring at birth. The more charactered people become, the less concerned they are with themselves. Their focus blends self-love with concern for the quality of others' lives. The people who walk the healthy path discover their core motives and bless others with the strengths from their Color. Unhealthy people share a common bond by choosing to see life primarily through their innate dysfunctional limitations. Less healthy individuals typically place greater emphasis on themselves, and most often at the expense of others. Individuals seeking the pathological path commonly present themselves as angry, self-obsessed, and spiritually dysfunctional. </p><p> <b>Why Choose the Charactered Path?</b> </p><p> <i>Character is defined as "learned" gifts.</i> The optimum motive for becoming charactered is service. Becoming trustworthy to serve requires us to be accountable for our innate strengths, limitations, and motives. To earn trust requires humility, courage, grace, and mastering the six steps of character. </p><p> The optimum motive of service drives us to stretch beyond our raw beginnings. While personalities are limited, character is not. Seeking to bless the lives of others challenges us to stretch in order to develop gifts where our innate personalities are limited. Character will not always equate with financial prosperity, but it will <i>always</i> enhance the quality of our lives. </p><p> Becoming charactered is an evolutionary process that will not appear the same to each color. Since character is "learned," what is character to a Red may look different to a Blue, White, or Yellow. Each color comes with inherent gifts that, when embraced by the other colors, become character. However, these same gifts remain defined as personality to the individual who brings them from birth. </p><p> The following case histories may help you identify your current path and level of functioning. I hope <i>Color Your Future</i> will help you choose the charactered path. </p><p> <b>Which Path Have You Chosen to Walk?</b> </p><p> <i>Two roads diverged in a wood and I,</i><br> I took the road less traveled...<br> Robert Frost </p><p> THE CHARACTERED PATH </p><p> <b><i>Charactered people will always be best remembered for the unnatural gifts they stretch to develop and freely share with others throughout life.</i></b> </p><p> Lecturing on <i>The Color Code,</i> I was intrigued one night when a gentleman, highly regarded for his expertise in early American history, approached me following my lecture and corrected a perception of mine. I had stated that Patrick Henry, one of America's Founding Fathers, had a Blue personality. He cited numerous references validating his position that Patrick Henry was clearly a Red personality rather than a Blue. Thanking him for his insights, I left rather puzzled. </p><p> Highly respected as a businessman with a brilliant political future, many felt certain that Patrick Henry was destined to be the president of the United States, when tragically, his wife became despondent and mentally ill. While Americans remain rather unforgiving of this illness, Patrick Henry's peers were brutal, believing that mental illness was a disease linked with religious impropriety, and often condemning mentally ill patients to a life void of human decency. Their society generally believed that diminished mental capacity indicated satanic possession and shunned the victim, often placing them behind bars to die in total isolation on slabs of cold cement. </p><p> To a Red Patrick Henry, mental illness did not make sense. He didn't understand or believe in it, but he recognized that his wife, by some bizarre twist of fate, was suffering tremendous pressure from the society they had once successfully embraced together. </p><p> Politically astute, Patrick Henry carefully deliberated over his dilemma. Should he dispose of his beloved wife and pursue the prestigious career he rightly deserved, or should he forsake his opportunities to care for the woman he loved? His character intact, his decision made, Patrick Henry returned home and closed the curtains at their home, and consequently the curtain</p></p><h2>Music by Computers</h2><p>Since the electronic computer was invented, its usefulness to society has been limited more by the imagination of man than by the capability of the hardware. The possibility of a computer creating music, art, or literature is perhaps obscure only because our pride forces us to believe these areas are man&#39;s exclusive provinces. The 1966 Fall Joint Computer Conference scheduled a highly creative, imaginative and enjoyable session on Computers in Music. The papers read there form the basis of this book, and focus on three aspects of the use of computers in generating music. First, computer hardware and software for implementing the generation of sounds are discussed under the heading Systems and Programs. Second, the versatility of digital computers in exploring rules of succession and synchronism is demonstrated in the section, Composition. Finally, the problem of judgment entering perception - i.e., what is &#34;beautiful&#34; and what is &#34;ugly,&#34; or to put it into information theoretical terms, what distinguishes signal from noise - is taken up in the section Aesthetics. At the end of the book, the reader may turn into a listener. A pocket of the back cover contains four high-fidelity records of all the examples mentioned in the text, which allows the testing of the presented theories by skeptics and enthusiasts alike.

At its centre is the plight of a woman who fears that the archaic marriage laws of Scotland and Ireland may have forced her into committing unintentional bigamy. As the novel progresses, the atmosphere grows increasingly sinister when the setting moves from a country house to a London suburb and a world of confinement, plotting, and murder.</p><p>Wilkie Collins was born in London in 1824, the elder son of a successful painter, William Collins. He left school at 17, and after an unhappy spell as a clerk in a tea broker&#39;s office, during which he wrote his first, unpublished novel, he entered Lincoln&#39;s Inn as a law student in 1846. He considered a career as a painter, but after the publication, in 1848, of his life of his father, and a novel, Antonina, in 1850, his future as a writer was assured. His meeting with Dickens in 1851 was perhaps the turning-point of his career. The two became collaborators and lifelong friends. Collins contributed to Dickens&#39;s magazines Household Words and All the Year Round, and his two best-known novels, The Woman in White and The Moonstone, were first published in All the Year Round. Collins&#39;s private life was as complex and turbulent as his novels. He never married, but lived with a widow, Mrs. Caroline Graves, from 1858 until his death. He also had three children by a younger woman, Martha Rudd, whom he kept in a separate establishment. Collins suffered from &#39;rheumatic gout&#39;, a form of arthritis which made him an invalid in his later years, and he became addicted to the laudanum he took to ease the pain of the illness. He died in 1889.Norman Page is Emeritus Professor of English Literature at the University of Nottingham.

A true cornucopia, <em>The New Oxford Book of Food Plants</em> overflows with information and is packed with beautiful, hand-painted illustrations of the world's food plants. In an oversized format with alternating full-page color plates, readers will find a feast of facts about cereals, sugar crops, oil seeds, nuts, legumes, fruits, vegetables, spices, herbs, sea-weeds, mushrooms, wild food plants, and much more besides. <br> The book, for example, provides authoritative coverage of fruit worldwide, both the varieties you commonly find at your local food stand (apples, oranges, strawberries, kiwi, bananas), and some you might not ordinarily see (mangosteen, manzanilla, marang, tamarind, or whortleberry). Similarly, we can uncover information on vegetables from acorn squash, asparagus, and broccoli, to truffle, turnips, watercress, and zucchini; nuts from the beechnut and the betel nut to the pistachio and the walnut; and herbs from anise and arrowroot to tarragon and wintergreen. Entries typically discuss the source and history of a plant, how it is prepared for market, and how it is used as food. Thus, for the Common Bean, we learn that it is the most widely cultivated bean in the world; that it has a host of local varieties and names (including French Beans, String Beans, Snap Beans, Frijoles); that remains have been found in Mexico that date back seven thousand years; that it is used in dishes that range from France's cassoulet to Mexican chili; and we even learn that one type of cultivar, known as "nuoas," is grown only in very high altitudes in South America and that it "pops" when cooked, rather like pop corn. And the illustrations for the Common Bean show the flowers, pods, and seeds of several varieties, including the Climbing Purple-Podded Kidney Bean, the Brown Haricot, the White Haricot, and the Mexican Black Bean. And in addition to covering everything from beverage crops to tropical root crops, the editor has included a glossary of botanical terms, a section on nutrition and health, nutrition tables, a list of recommended readings, and an index. <br> With marvelous hand-painted illustrations and a wealth of nutritional, historical, and other information, <em>The New Oxford Book of Food Plants</em> belongs on the shelf of everyone who loves to garden, to cook, and to eat healthily.</p><p>Not enough tables of contents are enhanced by drawings of nuts, herbs, and root vegetables, but the table of contents in <i>The New Oxford Book of Food Plants</i> is, setting the tone for a book that clearly delights in the glories of the world's bounty. Each chapter, including grain crops and fruits, spices and seaweed, legumes and mushrooms among its 19 topics, is a cornucopia of information and beautiful, educational illustrations. Take the chapter on oil crops, for example. Covering olives, sesame, peanuts, soy beans, sunflowers, and the rape plant, the prose describes where they grow and what the fruits look like, what kind of oil is produced and what it's used for, how it's made and how else the fruits may be used. Color drawings of the plants and their fruits are on the facing page. Put together by writers who respect each plant and give them the attention and detail that spell quality, this is a beautiful book and a charming resource. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i><br><em>About the Authors:</em><br><strong>John Vaughan</strong> is Emeritus Professor of Food Sciences at King's College, London. <strong>Catherine Geissler</strong> is Professor of Nutrition at King's College London.<br></p><h2>Oxford School Dictionary</h2><p>This dictionary has been written for students aged 11 to 16 for use at school and home.

As the first handheld camera, the Leica made possible a new kind of documentary photography, and included among its devoted fans are many of the century's greatest photographers. Its combined qualities of precision and compactness made it an essential tool for photographers everywhere, and today more than ever the Leica is prized by collectors. 120 color illustrations and photographs</p><p>Alessandro Pasi is the author of Beetle Mania. He lives in Milan, Italy.With the development of the 35mm Leica camera in 1913-1914 by Oscar Barnack at the Ernest Lietz factory, in Wetzlar, Germany, photography became portable, a lens through which the rapid change of the 20th century could be observed and recorded on the fly. Used by the likes of American war correspondent Robert Capa, anti-Nazi sociologist Gis�le Freund and revolutionary photographer Henri-Cartier Bresson, the Leica also attracted Nazi sympathizer Paul Wolff, controversial Third Reich documentarian Leni Reifenstahl, and the German military. This 9�"�11�" history of the Leica includes, among 120 color illustrations, a full-size color photograph, published in a 1944 issue of the German magazine <i>Signal</i>, of German soldiers riding on a tank's shadowy bulk past a burning house on the Eastern front. This is one of the most chilling photos in the book and one of the few full-size selections that is not a "best of" rendered slightly threadbare through over-reproduction. One page later, a strikingly undersized reproduction of a concentration camp is the only evidence of how, according to the text, the SS "photographed in great detail [using the Leica] the inhuman barbarities committed in the concentration camps throughout Europe"-a questionable juxtaposition at best. The text, by Italian journalist Pasi, is stilted to the point that it is often difficult to follow the history of the Leica's evolution or the significance of its innovations; however, there is enough technical information, with enlarged photos of each model and explanatory notes on lenses, viewfinders, range finders, film speeds and shutter-release buttons, to satisfy professionals and devotees. While the selection of smaller photographs is extensive and varied, the unpredictable sizings and intrusion into large photographs by small photographs and information boxes often detract from the photographs' impact.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The Holy Family reflects the real complexities of any family, but this is realism filled with vision, dream, and omen.</p><p>Saramago's deft psychological portrait of a savior who is at once the Son of God and a young man of this earth is an expert interweaving of poetry and irony, spirituality and irreverence. The result is nothing less than a brilliant skeptic's wry inquest into the meaning of God and of human existence.</p>Jose Saramago is one of the most important international writers of the last hundred years. Born in Portugal in 1922, he was in his sixties when he came to prominence as a writer with the publication of Baltasar and Blimunda.

Emancipated from nature by the progress of modern technology, we have at the same time become alienated from the Earth&#x2019;s cyclical patterns. Our religious life, once so deeply embedded in and supported by the natural world, has increasingly lost awareness of the profound rhythm in the festive year. Only perhaps at Christmas time and at Easter does a vague memory survive of the inter-relationship between earthly and cosmic events.</p> <p>In this collection of festival meditations, Emil Bock explores ways to deepen our understanding of the Christian festive year. An active renewal of the festivals today can not only heighten our appreciation of the Earth as a living organism, but can provide new energy for humanity&#x2019;s social life. Above all, the festivals are opportunities for new understanding of the Christ mystery that is breaking through in our time - the revelation of Christ in the etheric world.</p> <p>Nature is awaiting its own redemption through the work of man. In this sense, Bock&#x2019;s meditations are a clarion call for humanity to awaken to the spiritual task of our age.</p></p><p>Emil Bock (18951959) was one of the founders of the Christian Community in 1922, and led the movement from 1938 until his death.</p><h2>Vogel&#39;s Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry, Including Qualitative Organic Analysis</h2><p><p>Most widely used, established and respected reference manual for the organic chemistry laboratory.

Practices which construct this &#x2018;manhood&#x2019;, such as sadomasochism, cutting and piercing, female-to-male transsexual surgery, and which are promoted in queer politics, need to be understood as forms of self-harm which result from the oppression of lesbians and gay men. The political agenda of queer politics is damaging to the interests of lesbians, women in general, and to marginalized and vulnerable constituencies of gay men.<br> </p> <p>The book concludes by arguing that precisely the commitment to equality in relationships and sex that has been so important to lesbian feminists, and so excoriated in much of queer theory, should form the basis of a social transformation. In this way lesbians should be seen as the vanguard of social change.</p></p><p>Associate Professor, Department of Political Science, University of Melbourne'An incisive and challenging critique of queer politics, with the radical clarity of vision characteristic of Jeffreys' work.

Through its inclusion of so many notes copied by Hardy from old pocket-books subsequently destroyed, "Poetical Matter" reaches back to all periods of his life, and is especially valuable from a biographical standpoint for its expansion and enhancement of knowledge of Hardy's final years and for its preservation of such intimate records as his richly revealing memories of the Bockhampton of his childhood and his sexually charged impressions of a woman glimpsed during a trip on a pleasure steamer in 1868. Its special distinctiveness nevertheless lies in its uniqueness as a late working notebook devoted specifically to verse. Florence Hardy, Hardy's widow, recalled his having experienced a great outburst of late creativity, feeling that he could go on writing almost indefinitely, and "Poetical Matter" bears direct witness to his actively thinking about poetry and projecting and composing new poems until shortly before his death at the age of eighty-seven. As such, it contains an abundance of new ideas for poems and sequences of poems and demonstrates Hardy's characteristic creative progression, his working variously with initial ideas, with gathered notes, whether old or new, and with tentative prose formulations, verse fragments, metrical schemes, and rhyme patterns, towards the writing of the drafts from which, yet further worked and reworked, the completed poem would ultimately emerge.<br></p><p><br><strong>Pamela Dalziel</strong> is Distinguished University Scholar at the University of British Columbia and General Editor of the Clarendon Dickens Edition.

This invaluable handbook, updated with a new preface and a new case study on terrorism in Northern Ireland, sets out Gandhi&#x2019;s basic methods and illustrates them with practical examples. Juergensmeyer shows how parties at odds can rise above a narrow view of self-interest to find resolutions that are satisfying and beneficial to all involved. He then pits Gandhi&#x2019;s ideas against those of other great social thinkers in a series of imaginary debates that challenge and clarify Gandhi&#x2019;s thinking on issues of violence, anger, and love. He also provides a Gandhian critique of Gandhi himself and offers viable solutions to some of the gaps in Gandhian theory. <br><br><b><i>Gandhi&#x2019;s Way: A Handbook of Conflict Resolution</i> was previously published as <i>Fighting with Gandhi </i>and <i>Fighting Fair.</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;A fascinating, thought-provoking, helpful and heartening book.&#x201d;&#x2015;<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;Juergensmeyer&#x2019;s book is something of a Gandhian tour de force &#x2015; a careful analysis and series of applications of Gandhi&#x2019;s concepts of satyagraha ... to everyday situations with which most Western readers are familiar.&#x201d;&#x2015;<i>Religious Studies Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;This is a manual of instruction in the best sense: a popular reassessment of the activist use of satyagraha in conflict resolution that has depth and a true appreciation for the ethical subtleties of dialectical struggles, and for the multiple dimensions of &#x2018;passive resistance.&#x2019;&#x201d;&#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i><b>Mark Juergensmeyer</b> is Professor of Sociology at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

They love extremes of everything from fashion and art to music and the Internet. Observed and studied by experts of all kinds, their behavior monitored by psychologists, educators, and marketing executives, adolescents represent a decisive and increasingly valuable segment of the buying public. They adore and consume trendy clothes and brand-new bands; they must be cool regardless of the cost. And adults turn to them more and more for clues on how to remain forever young and hip. <i>The Fourth Sex</i> turns a critical, illustrated spotlight on adolescence, a territory of transition crisscrossed by the most varied creative energies. A series of iconographic materials begins in the 1960s and moves up to the present, revealing clothes, behavior patterns, novels, and visual artworks created or inspired by the transnational tribe that are teenagers. Excerpted authors include David Foster Wallace, Arata Isozaki, Philip Roth, William Golding, J.G. Ballard, Beavis &amp; Butthead, Jim Carroll, Stephen King, Vladimir Nabokov, Douglas Coupland, Dick Hebdige, Bret Easton Ellis, and Dave Eggers. Represented artists include Vanessa Beecroft, Raymond Pettibon, Mike Kelley, Elizabeth Peyton, Karen Kilimnik, Charles Ray, Takashi Murakami, Larry Clark, Rineke Dijkstra, Paul McCarthy, Richard Prince, Gilbert &amp; George, Gavin Turk, and Richard Billingham. And modeled fashion and lifestyle designers include Malcolm MacLaren, Paco Rabanne, Benetton, Veronique Branquinho, Comme des Gar ons, Stssy, Coca-Cola, PlayStation, Diesel, Katherine Hamnett, and David Sims.

The book highlights the power that those responsible for teaching and learning have to appraise, understand and positively transform their teaching. Seeing the teacher as a reflective learner, the book emphasises a strengths-based approach in which positivity, resilience, optimism and high performance can help invigorate teaching, enhance learning and allow the teacher to reach their full potential. This approach busts the myth that reflection on problems and deficits is the only way to better performance.</p> <p></p> <p>The approach of this new edition is an &#x2018;appreciative&#x2019; one. At its heart is the exploration and illustration of four reflective questions:</p> <p></p> <ul> <p> </p><li>What&#x2019;s working well?</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>What needs changing?</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>What are we learning?</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Where do we go from here?</li> <p></p></ul> <p></p> <p>With examples drawn from UK primary teacher education, the book reveals how appreciative reflective conversations can be initiated and sustained. It also sets out a range of practical processes for amplifying success. This book will be a must have for undergraduate and PGCE students on initial teacher training programmes. It will also interest practising teachers, teacher educators and those on continuing professional development courses.</p></p><p><p><strong>Tony Ghaye</strong> is an expert in positive psychology.

Johnson is the Murray Professor of English Literature at Princeton University.</p>Johnson places Jane Austen in a tradition of 18th-century women novelists who, while not overtly reformist, are skeptical of conservative ideology. These novels use the vocabulary of the family as a paradigm for the condition of the state, focusing on "the discourse rather than the representation of politics." Johnson, widely read in 18th-century philosophy, social analysis, and fiction, speedily rescues Austen from the "a-political" charge often leveled against her. She is less successful on the novels themselves, tending to isolate issues and insights without following through on their role in the novel or oeuvre as a wholeas when she sees Austen's heroes as exemplifying patriarchal positions without discussing their function as the object of the heroine's love.

This skill and passion for his subjects led to enormous success in the 30s and 40s as he was published in the leading fashion magazines of the day -- &#34;&#34;Vogue,&#34;&#34; &#34;&#34;Harper&#39;s Bazaar&#34;&#34; and others. But Platt Lynes was also a myth-maker with a photographic obsession that sadly remained mostly unpublicised until after his death. In collaboration with his male nude models he was able to transcend time and place -- these images simultaneously glance back as a &#34;&#34;homage&#34;&#34; to Greek mythology and athleticism, and look forward to the modern, urban eroticism of Robert Mapplethorpe and Bruce Weber. This book breaks down his body of work into distinct sections. The portraits include such luminaries of twentieth century art and society as Thomas Mann, Igor Stravinsky, Countess Bismarck and Gertrude Stein, as well as fellow lens-men Cecil Beaton and Henri Cartier-Bresson, and it is clear from the lighting and the often surreal framing that he was a master of the form. This extends into his work with ballet and fashion, but of course it is in his extensive nude images that his admiration for the male body and his expert technique are truly brought together.</p><p>Lynes paid his bills with fashion and portrait photography but is best known today for the work he cared most about--his homoerotic male nudes, which were little known in the 1940s and 1950s when he did them. It's hard to imagine Robert Mapplethorpe's or Bruce Weber's similar work, for example, had it not been for Lynes' precedent. Toward the rather sad end of his life in 1955, a patron came to Lynes--sex researcher Alfred Kinsey, who was eager to collect erotic photography and very interested in Lynes' pictures. Eighty images from the Kinsey Institute collection appear here, some of them male nudes but also portraits and fashion and dance work. Lynes knew how to make a beautiful photograph (his dramatic lighting techniques are breathtaking), and he had a deep sensitivity to human beauty. This well-chosen selection, both gorgeous and explicit (although never as outrageous as Mapplethorpe at his most notorious), includes only two of the photographs in <i>George Platt Lynes Photographs 1931-1955</i> (1982). Essays by Kinsey curator Crump on Lynes' place in the art world and on homoerotic culture provide needed context. <i>Gretchen Garner</i>Lynes gained some fame in the Thirties as a surrealist-associated fashion and dance photograher and for a short time was chief photographer of the Vogue studios. He also produced a large number of nudes. Alfred Kinsey's purchases of hundreds of these negatives and prints supplied a large portion of Lynes's income in the early Fifties, when his commercial assignments dropped off and no market for male nudes existed. In two essays, Crump, curator of the Kinsey archives, does a fine job describing Lynes's professional and personal life and reevaluating the historical significance of Lynes's nudes, rightly claiming "Mapplethorpe's vision owes a great deal more to Lynes than heretofore recognized." Unfortunately, close to half the 80 beautiful, full-page reproductions are of his less-important commercial work, and the majority of nudes are in the more sanitized "sculptural" style, leaving the reader wanting more material to evaluate Lynes's relation to today's homoerotic photographers. Recommended for large, modern-photography collections. --Eric Bryant, "Library Journal"<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Likeness: Portraits Of Artists By Other Artists</h2><p>Over 40 years ago, Andy Warhol promoted the concept that artists are celebrities, just as worthy of portrayal as other cultural icons. Likeness: Portraits of Artists by Other Artists begins where Warhol left off. Presenting visually striking and conceptually diverse works in a range of mediums, Likeness is the first exhibition and catalogue to propose a recent history of artists&#39; representations of other artists--of friends, peers, and idols. While any portrait is both a document and a personal record of the relationship between the artist and his or her subject, blurring distinctions between public and private, portraits of artists further enrich the situation; they commemorate and concretize the intimate social dramas of the art world and the economies of exchange. Selected here are over 50 paintings, drawings, photographs, and works in other media, created by a loose network of artists primarily active in New York, Los Angeles, London, and Berlin during the past three decades. Included are works by David Armstrong, AA Bronson, Bruce La Bruce, Chuck Close, Tacita Dean, Sam Durant, Nan Goldin, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Richard Hamilton, Mike Kelley, Sean Landers, Robert Mapplethorpe, Richard Misrach, Dave Muller, Paul Noble, Julian Opie, Elizabeth Peyton, Sigmar Polke, Richard Prince, Wolfgang Tillmans, James Welling, and others.</p><p></p><h2>Drone Threat (A Troy Pearce Novel)</h2><p><b>Troy Pearce and his team of drone experts are called to action when ISIS launches a series of attacks on U.S. soil.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> On the eve of President Lane&#x2019;s historic Asian Security Summit, a hobby-store quadcopter lands on the White House lawn carrying a package and an ominous threat: Fly the enclosed black flag of ISIS over the White House by noon today or suffer the consequences.

He cupped his hands around his eyes to get a better look, his spent RPG launcher heavy on one shoulder and his battered AK-47 on the other.</p><p>Not a Christ. A Christian, and a Kurd.</p><p>It was a <i>kafir</i> they had crucified, he reminded himself. His limp body hung from a utility pole on top of the hill, his arms tied at the elbows to the crossbar with bailing wire and duct tape. The <i>kafir</i> wouldn't submit, wouldn't renounce his infidel faith. </p><p>He crucified himself, Ahmed thought. He spat in the dust at his aching feet. The boots he wore were too small, taken from a dead Iraqi weeks ago. </p><p>He glanced back up. The blow flies swarmed around the moist tissues of the pastor's mouth and nose laying their eggs, the orifices caked with black blood. The eyes would be next, he knew. He'd seen it before, in the last village. And the one before. The hatched larvae would begin their grim feast and the pastor's skull would be picked clean in a week. Disgusting. Ahmed spat again.</p><p>Brave, this one. Not like the Iraqi soldiers who fled like women when his convoy of pickups arrived in a cloud of dust yesterday, each vehicle crowded with fighters like him, black ISIS flags flapping in the wind. The Iraqis just dropped their gear and ran.</p><p>Well, not all of them. </p><p>Was it the flags that scared the cowards? Or the head of an Iraqi colonel hanging like a lantern on a pole on the lead truck? The Iraqis were probably Shia. Worse than infidels. <i>C</i>leansing the Caliphate of all such non-believers was their sacred duty. Only through such cleansing and blood sacrifice will the <i>Mahdi</i> come with the Prophet Isa and defeat the anti-Christ. Has the Caliph not rightly taught that all of the signs are pointing toward the Day of Judgment? And was it not their duty to bring this about, one infidel corpse at a time?</p><p>Ahmed turned around. He counted ten more bodies hanging on the utility poles marching down the sloping hill, including three children. </p><p>The pastor's children. Children of iniquity.</p><p>Dirty work that, Ahmed thought. Glad he wasn't asked to do it. He would have, of course. Allah commands it. And if not, Kamal al-Medina ordered it, and he was more afraid of his commander here on earth than he was of the Exceedingly Merciful on his heavenly throne. He'd never seen Allah behead a screaming <i>kafir</i> with a serrated combat knife, nor listened to him sing while he did it. </p><p>Such zeal. It is to be admired, he thought.</p><p>A Dodge Ram pickup honked behind him. He turned around as the truck skidded to a halt in the dust. A sharp-faced brother called out from the cab. He was a twenty-five-year-old Tunisian from Marseilles. A French national like Ahmed, though Ahmed was a lily white redhead of Norman stock and only nineteen.</p><p>"The commander has called for you," the Tunisian said in French. He threw a thumb at the truck bed. "Hop in." </p><p>Ahmed felt his stomach drop and the back of his neck tingle.</p><p>"But I'm on guard duty."</p><p>"I'll take your place after I drop you off."</p><p>"Why does he want me?"</p><p>The Tunisian lowered his voice. "Does the Black Prince consult with lowly commoners like us?" He flashed a crooked smile. </p><p>The pejorative reference to Kamal al-Medina's royal bloodline would've earned the Tunisian ten lashes with a whip if Ahmed reported the slur. He wouldn't, of course. Ahmed used it too. They all did. And they all admired Kamal al-Medina as much as they feared him. The Saudi had given up everything--palaces, gold, power--to fight for the Caliphate and the Ummah.</p><p>"No, he doesn't."&nbsp; Ahmed unslung his RPG launcher and rifle and clambered into the back of the Dodge. He slapped the cab roof and the truck whipped around, speeding toward the center of the small village of squat cinderblock houses, well-kept and brightly painted in hues of red, blue and yellow. Most doors were defaced with a spray-painted red Arabic "N." <i>Nasrane.</i> A slur for Jesus the Nazarene and his followers. </p><p>It was also a mark for death.</p><p>Their truck sped past still more utility poles with a Christian corpse hanging from each, their sightless, downcast eyes keeping silent vigil over their lost village. The long shadows they cast were quickly fading in the dimming light. It would soon be time for the brothers to wash and for evening prayers.</p><p>If only these Christians had submitted, Ahmed thought. Submitted to the will of Allah and signed the Dhimma contract and paid the <i>jizya</i>--perhaps that would have kept them from death. Easier still, they could have just lied to save their lives and fight another day. Was <i>taqiyya</i> not permitted in their Book as well?</p><p>He liked this village. It was neat and well-organized and surrounded by fertile fields. A village not much different than the one he came from in Normandy. He wondered how soon before those utility poles back home would be filled with Crusader corpses, too. He hoped he lived long enough to see it and to see even the whole world under the great Caliphate of God.</p><p><i>Inshallah</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>#</p><p>The pickup skidded to a stop in front of the church guarded by two jihadis, an almond-eyed Kazakh and a graying Uzbek. Both good fighters, Ahmed knew. And zealous.</p><p>Ahmed leaped out of the truck bed and the Dodge sped off. Ahmed stood a moment, unsure of his situation. Had he sinned? The commander's zeal for God knew no bounds. Just last week he punished a brother who kept smoking cigarettes in secret. Sharia forbade it. Smoking was <i>haram</i>. "There are no secrets here. God knows all and he will not honor us if we don't keep his law," al-Medina proclaimed before personally delivering the forty lashes to the brother's back with a thick leather whip.</p><p>Ahmed weighed his chances against the two guards. There were no bullets in his battered rifle and his RPG had no grenade--not that he could've used either in close quarters combat. He had his grandfather's old folding knife in his pocket but that wasn't much of a weapon either. Both guards were well armed and could kill with their hands. He'd seen it himself. Perhaps he could run but then they would shoot him in the back like a dog.</p><p>The Uzbek nodded a dour greeting and pushed open one of the two front doors and signaled him to follow.</p><p>Ahmed hesitated before the open door. He hadn't stood in a Christian church since he was a child--his first communion. The small stone church in his village had long since been abandoned by the last Catholic faithful and converted into a bike shop. Still, he wondered what judgment might be waiting for him inside this holy place after a day of slaughter. The sun had fallen beneath the hills and the long shadows had given way to a general gloom.</p><p>"He's waiting for you," the Uzbek said. "Follow me."</p><p>Inshallah, Ahmed said to himself again with a shrug. He followed the Uzbek in. The old fighter limped heavily on his left foot into the broad expanse of the sanctuary and down the rows of mostly empty pews. The aisles were littered with chunks of broken plaster, half-melted candles, torn hymnals and spent cartridges. A few of the brothers were passed out on the long benches, snoring from exhaustion. Three unit sub-commanders stood on the raised platform and used a communion table to study a map they had laid upon it. A few dim bulbs in a chandelier overhead threw a sickly yellow light around them. A black ISIS flag hung from the rafters.</p><p>Ahmed's eyes drifted to the smashed ceramic Christ crunching beneath their feet, broken into a dozen pieces and tossed like garbage around the floor. This pleased him. A false Christ these <i>kafir</i> worship, and an idol at that.</p><p>The Uzbek led Ahmed to another door to the side of the sanctuary. He knocked on it. "Enter!" boomed from the other side. Ahmed recognized al-Medina's commanding voice.</p><p>The Uzbek nodded curtly to Ahmed then hobbled away.</p><p>Ahmed took a deep breath then pushed open the door.</p><p>Kamal al-Medina sat behind a small wooden desk, and his two senior commanders sat in a worn leather couch against one wall near him. The room was spacious and lined with crowded bookshelves. A small side table was dedicated to framed photographs of the pastor, his wife and three children. The wife was stunning. This must have been the pastor's office, Ahmed concluded.</p><p>"Brother Ahmed!" Al-Medina stood. A wide grin spread beneath his dark wooly beard. His lieutenants rose as well, also smiling.</p><p>Al-Medina came around from behind the desk and wrapped Ahmed in a bear hug. The other two commanders did likewise.</p><p>"Emir?" was all Ahmed could muster in his confusion.</p><p>Al-Medina laughed and spoke to him in French. "No need for the formalities. We're all brothers here, yes?"</p><p>Ahmed nodded, tried to answer him in faltering Arabic. Al-Medina held up a hand.</p><p>"I attended a private school in Switzerland, so French is no problem for me. But we can speak English or German if you prefer."</p><p>"I like, eh, want the language of the Prophet, peace be upon him," Ahmed insisted in broken Arabic.</p><p>"But I prefer to practice my French if you don't mind," al-Medina insisted.</p><p>"<i>�a va</i>," Ahmed said.</p><p>"Excellent! Can I get you something to drink? Water, coffee?"</p><p>"No, sir. I'm fine. How can I be of service?"</p><p>Al-Medina clapped him hard on the shoulder. "You already have, my young lion. I heard what you did yesterday." Al-Medina pantomimed holding an RPG on his shoulder and firing it. "You killed those three Iraqis barricaded in the house firing their machine gun. They had the front echelon pinned down with their murderous weapon. But you jumped into the street and put a HEAT round right into their window. BOOM!" </p><p>Al-Medina clapped his hands when he said the word and laughed. The others laughed too.</p><p>Al-Medina switched back to Arabic. "You saved many brothers that day. I just wanted to take the time now to properly thank you, and reward you. Do you understand?"</p><p>"Yes, a little," Ahmed said, embarrassed by his poor Arabic skills.</p><p>Al-Medina signaled with his hand. "Follow me."</p><p>Al-Medina led Ahmed and the other commanders to an adjoining room. Stacks of American rifles, grenade launchers, ammo boxes and even fresh Iraqi uniforms still in their plastic bags lined the walls. </p><p>"Take your pick. All courtesy of the United States government," al-Medina said with another laugh.</p><p>"For me? Anything? Truly?" In his excitement, Ahmed fell back into his French. He snatched up a brand new M-4 carbine still glistening with lubricant.</p><p>"Anything you need or want." Al-Medina opened up a box. "Here, brand new boots if you need them."</p><p>"Boots!" Ahmed set his new weapon down and raced over to the box of boots and began sifting through them looking for his size.</p><p>"But there's something more for our young hero," one of the commanders said, chuckling.</p><p>"Ah, yes. I almost forgot," al-Medina said through a wide grin.</p><p>Ahmed looked up.</p><p>"Come, boy. Something better indeed."</p><p>The other men laughed.</p><p>Al-Medina led the nineteen year old to yet another door that opened to a great room. A dozen women sat cowering on the floor, their faces covered by hajibs. But their downcast eyes told all, dazed and red with tears. Some were even blackened. </p><p>"Take one."</p><p>"Sir?"</p><p>Al-Medina shouted an order. The women all jumped to their feet as one, startled by the harshness of his voice. They immediately pulled off their hajibs. Some were younger than Ahmed. Two were blonde. Al-Medina saw Ahmed's gaze fall on one particular girl a few years older than he. Her dark blue eyes were wide with terror.&nbsp; She covered her bruised mouth with one trembling hand.</p><p>"That one is an American. An aide worker. The trucks are coming first thing in the morning to pick them all up and take them to market. But you can have her until then." He nudged Ahmed. "She's good, I can tell you."</p><p>"And it is not <i>haram</i>?" Ahmed had been taught that sex outside of marriage was forbidden by the Koran.</p><p>"It is <i>Mut'ah</i>. A temporary marriage for your pleasure," al-Medina assured him. "The imam will bless it."</p><p>Ahmed's face flushed crimson, matching his thin beard. He couldn't believe his good fortune. He'd never been with a woman before.</p><p>The three older jihadis laughed at the boy's innocence.</p><p>"That one, then" Ahmed said, pointing at a dark-eyed beauty in the back, trying to hide her face.</p><p>Al-Medina pounded Ahmed's shoulder. "The pastor's wife! Excellent choice."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>#</p><p>He prayed to God before he raped her. They all did.</p><p>So did she. </p><p>Not the same prayer. </p><p>Not the same God.</p><p>The red-haired boy lay next to her sleeping. He looked more child than man in the light of the single bulb when he first took her. But he was no child. More like a rutting pig. He stank of his own urine and sweat after days in the field. Too eager to care to bathe before the filthy act.</p><p>She had wiped herself clean of him with the sheets after he had finished but otherwise didn't move. He passed out soon afterward. She lay in the dark with her eyes fixed on the invisible ceiling praying for the strength she'd need in the coming hours. She counted his breaths again, deep and long. Satisfied he was fast asleep, she reached for the razor blade she'd hidden in her garment folded neatly on the floor next to the mattress. Everything in her wanted to slit his throat and let him bleed out in his "marriage" bed. But there was too much at stake, and too many other lives hung in the balance. Her husband, she knew, was watching too. He wouldn't have approved of her killing him even though the boy had raped her in his own bed. Her husband was a true Christian.</p><p>Certain the pig was out for the night, she carefully extricated herself from the tangled sheets. She stood slowly, then bent over to fetch her garment. </p><p>Suddenly he stirred. </p><p>No! She caught her breath. But he just rolled over and fell back into the deep rhythms of exhausted sleep.</p><p>She uttered a silent thanks and dressed quickly. It was pitch black but this was her bedroom and she knew every square inch of it, so there was no need to turn the lamp back on. She stepped blindly but carefully toward the small night stand and reached behind it. Her groping fingers found the hidden cell phone. She listened again for the jihadi's breathing. He was still asleep. She opened the phone. One thirty-five. She panicked. Was there still enough time? The signal showed only one bar and less than ten percent of charge left on the battery. She prayed it would be enough. </p><p>She prayed she wasn't too late. </p><p>She texted her message, hit send, and prayed again. She touched the blade in her garment, a small comfort. She would use it on herself if tonight failed. Tonight would be the last humiliation, one way or another, she told he...</p></p><h2>A Year at North Hill: Four Seasons in a Vermont Garden</h2><p>Two landscape artists reveal the secrets of their successful five-acre garden, offering tips on perennials, rock gardens, roses, bog gardens, wildflowers, shrubs, conifers vegetables, and other plants</p><p>"Passionate, reflective, inspiring, endlessly quotable, and filled with good humor and humanity.

Karleskint enjoys teaching because it gives him the opportunity to help students understand the wonders of life and the special, and even somewhat mysterious, biological world in which they live. In 1994 he was given the outstanding teacher award by the Xi Lambda chapter of Phi Theta Kappa. George first became interested in marine biology as a child, on trips to Florida when he wanted to know more about the shells he collected. By the time he was in college he had learned so much about molluscs and taxonomy that he was something of a local expert on the topic. His varied college and graduate school interests (first chemistry, then biology, then invertebrate zoology) culminated in his current specialty of physiology. His family shares his love of travel, the ocean, and marine creatures.<br><br>Dr. Richard Turner joined the faculty of Florida Tech in 1976. His postdoctoral studies were done at Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution (1982-1983). He has served as president of the Florida Academy of Sciences (1985-1986, 2009-2011) and is business manager (1994 to present) of the Florida Scientist, the journal of the Florida Academy of Sciences. He has 34 publications in refereed journals and books. Dr. Turner's research has been focused on the general biology of echinoderms, a group of marine animals that include seastars, sea urchins, and brittlestars. Other research projects include general biology of the Florida applesnail, fossilization of the Atlantic ghost crab, and the role of beachhoppers in processing of beach wrack and in transport of marine mites.<br><br>James W. Small, Jr., is Professor of Biology at Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida where he has taught for 36 years. He also serves as the College's Chief Pre-Health Professions Advisor. He obtained the Bachelor of Science degree in zoology at the University of North Carolina and received his M.S. degree in zoology and Ph.D degree in Biological Sciences from the University of Kentucky (1972). His dissertation was on the bioenergetics of stream fishes, but he has also done extensive work on the ecology of the Central Florida lakes for many years, involving many students in his ecological studies. Professor Small began team teaching marine biology in 1976, with on campus lectures and laboratory experiences on the Florida coasts, the Florida Keys, Barbados, and Hawaii. The Barbados and Hawaii laboratories have been offered on a two year rotation and involve taking students to professional marine biology laboratories (McGill University in Barbados or the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology in Hawaii) for 14-21 days where they collect organisms and study various marine ecosystems. Particular emphasis is given to the study of mangroves, coral reefs, and the rocky intertidal communities. He has also taught a course for college teachers on tropical intertidal biology (in Barbados) and has authored publications on fish systematics, ecology, and teaching.</p><h2>Henry Walters and Bernard Berenson: Collector and Connoisseur</h2><p><p>Collecting Italian Renaissance paintings during America&#x2019;s Gilded Age was fraught with risk because of the uncertain identities of the artists and the conflicting interests of the dealers. Stanley Mazaroff&#x2019;s fascinating account of the close relationship between Henry Walters, founder of the legendary Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, and Bernard Berenson, the era&#x2019;s preeminent connoisseur of Italian paintings, richly illustrates this important chapter of America&#x2019;s cultural history. </p><p>When Walters opened his Italianate museum in 1909, it was labeled as America&#x2019;s "Great Temple of Art." With more than 500 Italian paintings, including self-portraits purportedly by Raphael and Michelangelo, Walters&#x2019;s collection was compared favorably with the great collections in London, Paris, and Berlin. In the midst of this fanfare, Berenson contacted Walters and offered to analyze his collection, sell him additional paintings, and write a scholarly catalogue that would trumpet the collection on both sides of the Atlantic. What Berenson offered was what Walters desperately needed&#x2015;a badge of scholarship that Berenson&#x2019;s invaluable imprimatur would undoubtedly bring. </p><p>By 1912, Walters had become Berenson&#x2019;s most active client, their business alliance wrapped in a warm and personal friendship. But this relationship soon became strained and was finally severed by a confluence of broken promises, inattention, deceit, and ethical conflict. To Walters&#x2019;s chagrin, Berenson swept away the self-portraits allegedly by Raphael and Michelangelo and publicly scorned paintings that he was supposed to praise. Though painful to Walters, Berenson&#x2019;s guidance ultimately led to a panoramic collection that beautifully told the great history of Italian Renaissance painting. </p><p>Based primarily on correspondence and other archival documents recently discovered at the Walters Art Museum and the Villa I Tatti in Florence, the intriguing story of Walters and Berenson offers unusual insight into the pleasures and perils of collecting Italian Renaissance paintings, the ethics in the marketplace, and the founding of American art museums.</p></p><p><p>Recognized annually in <i>Best Lawyers in America</i>, <b>Stanley Mazaroff</b> retired from the active practice of law to study art history at the Johns Hopkins University.

Students are pushed to consider how and why institutions and rules determine who wins and who loses in American politics, and to be savvy consumers of political information.&nbsp;<br> <br> The thoroughly updated <strong>Ninth</strong> <strong>Edition</strong> considers how a major component of power is who controls the information, how it is assembled into narratives, and whether we come to recognize fact from fiction. Citizens now have unprecedented access to power &#x2013; the ability to create and share their own narratives &#x2013; while simultaneously being even more vulnerable to those trying to shape their views. The political landscape of today gives us new ways to keep the republic, and some high-tech ways to lose it.&nbsp;<br> <br> Throughout the text and its features, authors Christine Barbour and Gerald Wright show students how to effectively apply the critical thinking skills they develop to the political information they encounter every day. Students are challenged to deconstruct prevailing narratives and effectively harness the political power of the information age for themselves.&nbsp;<br> <br> Up-to-date with 2018 election results and analysis, as well as the impact of recent Supreme Court rulings, shifting demographics, and emerging and continuing social movements, <strong>Keeping the Republic, <em>Ninth Edition</em></strong> is a much-needed resource to help students make sense of politics in America today.<br> <br> <strong>Keeping the Republic, <em>The Essentials</em></strong> is identical to the full version of the text, minus the three policy chapters.<br> </p> <p><strong>Also available as a digital option (courseware)</strong>.

I always tell our adjuncts that just using the ideas in the book will make you seem so smart and creative. We also like the amount of materials provided. It's not too cram-packed with distracting pictures and text, but there is enough to keep the students on their toes. The grammar covered is just enough.

The city, London. A man lies dead in an empty house, not a mark upon him, and no clues&#x2014;save for the word "RACHE" scrawled in blood on the wall above. Elsewhere, two men&#x2014;a former army doctor called John Watson and a brilliant eccentric called Sherlock Holmes&#x2014;meet for the first time. These two events set in motion an adventure into the darkest corners of men's hearts as the cold, calculating investigative methods of Mr. Holmes are put to the test in a case that spans decades and continents, rife with danger and intrigue.</p><p>Originally published in 1887, <em>A Study in Scarlet</em> was the first novel to feature a character whose name would become synonymous with the art of deduction. Today it is completely reimagined with artwork by the modern master of gothic romanticism, Gris Grimly, bringing this thrilling tale of love and revenge to a new generation of readers.</p></p><p>Arthur Conan Doyle's <i>Study in Scarlet</i> is the first published story involving the legendary Sherlock Holmes, arguably the world's best-known detective, and the first narrative by Holmes's Boswell, the unassuming Dr. Watson, a military surgeon lately returned from the Afghan War. Watson needs a flat-mate and a diversion. Holmes needs a foil. And thus a great literary collaboration begins.<p> Watson and Holmes move to a now-famous address, 221B Baker Street, where Watson is introduced to Holmes's eccentricities as well as his uncanny ability to deduce information about his fellow beings. Somewhat shaken by Holmes's egotism, Watson is nonetheless dazzled by his seemingly magical ability to provide detailed information about a man glimpsed once under the streetlamp across the road. </p><p> Then murder. Facing a deserted house, a twisted corpse with no wounds, a mysterious phrase drawn in blood on the wall, and the buffoons of Scotland Yard--Lestrade and Gregson--Holmes measures, observes, picks up a pinch of this and a pinch of that, and generally baffles his faithful Watson. Later, Holmes explains: "In solving a problem of this sort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backward.... There are few people who, if you told them a result, would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result." Holmes is in that elite group. </p><p> Conan Doyle quickly learned that it was Holmes's deductions that were of most interest to his readers. The lengthy flashback, while a convention of popular fiction, simply distracted from readers' real focus. It is when Holmes and Watson gather before the coal fire and Holmes sums up the deductions that led him to the successful apprehension of the criminal that we are most captivated. Subsequent Holmes stories--<i>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</i>, <i>The Return of Sherlock Holmes</i>, and <i>The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</i>--rightly plunge the twosome directly into the middle of a baffling crime, piling mystery upon mystery until Holmes's denouement once more leaves the dazzled Watson murmuring, "You are wonderful, Holmes!"

Their ground-breaking research has sparked a national response to sexism in schools, including the recent report from the American Association of University Women, "How Schools Shortchange Girls."<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><b><i>Hidden Lessons</i></b><br><br>Sitting in the same classroom, reading the same textbook, listening to the same teacher, boys and girls receive very different educations. From grade school through graduate school female students are more likely to be invisible members of classrooms. Teachers interact with males more frequently, ask them better questions, and give them more precise and helpful feedback. Over the course of years the uneven distribution of teacher time, energy, attention, and talent, with boys getting the lion's share, takes its toll on girls. Since gender bias is not a noisy problem, most people are unaware of the secret sexist lessons and the quiet losses they engender.<br><br>Girls are the majority of our nation's schoolchildren, yet they are second-class educational citizens. The problems they face -- loss of selfesteem, decline in achievement, and elimination of career options -- are at the heart of the educational process. Until educational sexism is eradicated, more than half our children will be shortchanged and their gifts lost to society.<br><br>Award-winning author Susan Faludi discovered that backlash "is most powerful when it goes private, when it lodges inside a woman's mind and turns her vision inward, until she imagines the pressure is all in her head, until she begins to enforce the backlash too -- on herself." Psychological backlash internalized by adult women is a frightening concept, but what is even more terrifying is a curriculum of sexist school lessons becoming secret mind games played against female children, our daughters, tomorrow's women.<br><br>After almost two decades of research grants and thousands of hours of classroom observation, we remain amazed at the stubborn persistence of these hidden sexist lessons. When we began our investigation of gender bias, we looked first in the classrooms of one of Washington, D.C.'s elite and expensive private schools. Uncertain of exactly what to look for, we wrote nothing down; we just observed. The classroom was a whirlwind of activity, so fast paced we could easily miss the quick but vital phrase or gesture, the insidious incident, the tiny inequity that held a world of meaning. As we watched, we had to push ourselves beyond the blind spots of socialization and gradually focus on the nature of the interaction between teacher and student. On the second day we saw our first example of sexism, a quick, jarring flash within the hectic pace of the school day:<br><br>Two second graders are kneeling beside a large box. They whisper excitedly to each other as they pull out wooden blocks, colored balls, counting sticks. So absorbed are these two small children in examining and sorting the materials, they are visibly startled by the teacher's impatient voice as she hovers over them. "Ann! Julia! Get your cotton-pickin' hands out of the math box. Move over so the boys can get in there and do their work."<br><br>Isolated here on the page of a book, this incident is not difficult to interpret. It becomes even more disturbing if you think of it with the teacher making a racial distinction. Picture Ann and Julia as AfricanAmerican children moved away so white children can gain access to the math materials. If Ann and Julia's parents had observed this exchange, they might justifiably wonder whether their tuition dollars were well spent. But few parents actually watch teachers in action, and fewer still have learned to interpret the meaning behind fast-paced classroom events.<br><br>The incident unsettles, but it must be considered within the context of numerous interactions this harried teacher had that day. While she talked to the two girls, she was also keeping a wary eye on fourteen other active children. Unless you actually shadowed the teacher, stood right next to her as we did, you might not have seen or heard the event. After all, it lasted only a few seconds.<br><br>It took us almost a year to develop an observation system that would register the hundreds of daily classroom interactions, teasing out the gender bias embedded in them. Trained raters coded classrooms in math, reading, English, and social studies. They observed students from different racial and ethnic backgrounds. They saw lessons taught by women and by men, by teachers of different races. In short, they analyzed America's classrooms. By the end of the year we had thousands of observation sheets, and after another year of statistical analysis, we discovered a syntax of sexism so elusive that most teachers and students were completely unaware of its influence?<br><br>Recently a producer of NBC's "Dateline" contacted us to learn more about our discovery that girls don't receive their fair share of education. Jane Pauley, the show's anchorwoman, wanted to visit classrooms, capture these covert sexist lessons on videotape, and expose them before a television audience. The task was to extricate sound bites of sexism from a fifth-grade classroom where the teacher, chosen to be the subject of the expos�, was aware she was being scrutinized for sex bias.<br><br>"Dateline" had been taping in her class for two days when we received a concerned phone call. "This is a fair teacher," the producer said. "How can we show sexism on our show when there's no gender bias in this teacher's class?" We drove to the NBC studio in Washington, D.C., and found two "Dateline" staffers, intelligent women concerned about fair treatment in school, sitting on the floor in a darkened room staring at the videotape of a fifth-grade class. "We've been playing this over and over. The teacher is terrific. There's no bias in her teaching. Come watch."<br><br>After about twenty minutes of viewing, we realized it was a case of d�j� vu: The episodal sexist themes and recurring incidents were all too familiar. The teacher was terrific, but she was more effective for half of the students than she was for the other. She was, in fact, a classic example of the hundreds of skillful well-intentioned professionals we have seen who inadvertently teach boys better than girls.<br><br>We had forgotten how difficult it was to recognize subtle sexism before you learn how to look. It was as if the "Dateline" staff members were wearing blinders. We halted the tape, pointed out the sexist behaviors, related them to incidents in our research, and played the tape again. There is a classic "aha!" effect in education when people finally "get it." Once the hidden lessons of unconscious bias are understood, classrooms never look the same again to the trained observer.<br><br>Much of the unintentional gender bias in that fifth-grade class could not be shown in the short time allowed by television, but the sound bites of sexism were also there. "Dateline" chose to show a segregated math group: boys sitting on the teacher's right side and girls on her left. After giving the math book to a girl to hold open at the page of examples, the teacher turned her back to the girls and focused on the boys, teaching them actively and directly. Occasionally she turned to the girls' side, but only to read the examples in the book. This teacher, although aware that she was being observed for sexism, had unwittingly transformed the girls into passive spectators, an audience for the boys. All but one, that is: The girl holding the math book had become a prop.<br><br>"Dateline" also showed a lively discussion in the school library. With both girls' hands and boys' hands waving for attention, the librarian chose boy after boy to speak. In one interaction she peered through the forest of girls' hands waving directly in front of her to acknowledge the raised hand of a boy in the back of the room. Startled by the teacher's attention, the boy muttered, "I was just stretching."<br><br>The next day we discussed the show with future teachers, our students at The American University. They were bewildered. "Those teachers really were sexist. They didn't mean to be, but they were. How could that happen -- with the cameras and everyone watching?" When we took those students into classrooms to discover the hidden lessons for themselves, they began to understand. It is difficult to detect sexism unless you know precisely how to observe. And if a lifetime of socialization makes it difficult to spot gender bias even when you're looking for it, how much harder it is to avoid the traps when you are the one doing the teaching.<br><br><b><i>Among Schoolchildren</i></b><br><br>Subtle sexism is visible to only the most astute readers of <i>Among Schoolchildren,</i> Tracy Kidder's chronicle of real-life educator Chris Zajac. A thirty-four-year-old teacher in Mt. Holyoke, Massachusetts, Mrs. Zajac is a no-nonsense veteran of the classroom. She does not allow her fifth-grade students to misbehave, forget to do their homework, or give up without trying their hardest. Underlying her strict exterior is a woman who cares about schoolchildren. Our students admired her dedication and respected her as a good human being, and it took several readings and discussions before they discovered her inadvertent gender bias. Then came the questions: Does Mrs. Zajac work harder teaching boys than girls? Does she know there is sex bias in her classroom?<br><br>These questions probably do not occur to most readers of <i>Among Schoolchildren</i> and might jolt both Chris Zajac and the author who so meticulously described the classroom. Here's how Tracy Kidder begins the story of a year in the life of this New England teacher:<br><br>"Mrs. Zajac wasn't born yesterday. She knows you didn't do your best work on this paper, Clarence. Don't you remember Mrs. Zajac saying that if you didn't do your best, she'd make you do it over? As for you, Claude, God forbid that you should ever need brain surgery. But Mrs. Zajac hopes that if you do, the doctor won't open up your head and walk off saying he's almost done, as you said when Mrs. Zajac asked you for your penmanship, which, by the way, looks like who did it and ran. Felipe, the reason you have hiccups is, your mouth is always open and the wind rushes in. You're in fifth grade now. So, Felipe, put a lock on it. Zip it up. Then go get a drink of water. Mrs. Zajac means business, Robert. The sooner you realize she never said everybody in the room has to do the work except for Robert, the sooner you'll get along with her. And...Clarence. Mrs. Zajac knows you didn't try. You don't just hand in junk to Mrs. Zajac. She's been teaching an awful lot of years. She didn't fall off the turnip cart yesterday. She told you she was an old-lady teacher."<br><br>Swiftly, adroitly, Kidder introduces the main characters in the classroom -- Clarence, Claude, Felipe, Robert, and back to Clarence, the boy in whom Mrs. Zajac invests most. But where are the girls?<br><br>As our students analyzed the book and actually examined who Mrs. Zajac was speaking to, they saw that page after page she spent time with the boys -- disciplining them, struggling to help them understand, teaching them with all the energy and talent she could muster. In contrast, the pages that showed Mrs. Zajac working with girls were few and far between.<br><br>arWhen we ask teachers at our workshops why they spend more time helping boys, they say, "Because boys need it more" or "Boys have trouble reading, writing, doing math. They can't even sit still. They need me more." In <i>Among Schoolchildren,</i> Chris Zajac feels that way, too. Kidder describes how she allows boys to take her over because she thinks they need her.<br><br>So teachers of good intention, such as Chris Zajac, respond to boys and teach them more actively, but their time and attention are not limitless. While the teachers are spending time with boys, the girls are being ignored and shortchanged. The only girl clearly realized in <i>Among Schoolchildren</i> is Judith, a child who is so alert that she has a vast English vocabulary even though her parents speak only Spanish. But while Judith is a girl of brilliant potential, she rarely reaps the benefit of Mrs. Zajac's active teaching attention. In fact, rather than trouble her teacher and claim time and attention for herself, Judith helps Mrs. Zajac, freeing her to work with the more demanding boys. Mrs. Zajac knows she isn't giving this talented girl what she needs and deserves: "If only I had more time," she thinks as she looks at Judith.<br><br>On a field trip to Old Sturbridge Village, the children have segregated themselves by sex on the bus, with the boys claiming the back. In a moment of quiet reflection, Chris realizes that in her classroom "the boys rarely give her a chance to spend much time with her girls." She changes her seat, joins the girls, and sings jump rope songs with them for the remainder of the trip.<br><br>But her time spent with the girls is short-lived -- the length of the day-long field trip -- and her recognition of the gender gap in time and attention is brief: a paragraph-long flash of understanding in a book of more than three hundred pages. On the whole, Chris Zajac does not invest her talent in girls. But nurturing children is not unlike tending a garden: Neglect, even when benign, is withering; time and attention bear fruit. Mrs. Zajac and other caring teachers across the country are unaware of the full impact of uneven treatment. They do not realize the high academic and emotional price many girls pay for being too good.<br><br>Drawn from years of research, the episodes that follow demonstrate the sexist lessons taught daily in America's classrooms. Pulled out of the numerous incidents in a school day, these inequities become enlarged, as if observed through a magnifying glass, so we can see clearly how they extinguish learning and shatter self-esteem. Imagine yourself in a sixth-grade science class like the one we observed in Maryland.<br><br>The teacher is writing a list of inventors and their discoveries on the board:<br><br>Elias Howe<br><br>sewing machine<br><br>Robert Fulton<br><br>steamboat<br><br>Thomas A. Edison<br><br>light bulb<br><br>James Otis<br><br>elevator<br><br>Alexander Graham Bell<br><br>telephone<br><br>Cyrus McCormick<br><br>reaper<br><br>Eli Whitney<br><br>cotton gin<br><br>Orville and Wilbur Wright<br><br>airplane<br><br>A girl raises her hand and asks, "It looks like all the inventors were men. Didn't women invent anything?" The teacher does not add any female inventors to the list, nor does he discuss new scholarship recognizing the involvement of women in inventions such as the cotton gin. He does not explain how hard it was in times past for women to obtain patents in their own names, and therefore we may never know how many female inventors are excluded from the pages of our history books. Instead he grins, winks, and says, "Sweetheart, don't worry about it. It's the same with famous writers and painters. It's the man's job to create things and the woman's job to look beautiful so she can inspire him." Several boys laugh. A few clown around by flexing their muscles as they exclaim, "Yes!" One girl rolls her eyes toward the ceiling and shakes her head in disgust. The incident lasts less than a minute, and the discussion of male inventors continues.<br><br>We sometimes ask our students at The American University to list twenty famous women from American history. There are only a few restrictions. They cannot include figures from sports or entertainment. Presidents' wives are not allowed unless they are clearly famous in their own right. Most students cannot do it. The seeds of their ignorance were sown in their earliest years of schooling.<br><br>In the 1970s, analyses of best-selling history books showed a biological oddity, a nation with only founding fathers. More space was given to the six-shooter than to the women's suffrage movement. In fact, the typical history text gave only two sentences to enfranchising half the population. Science texts continued the picture of a one-gend...</p><h2>Journeys: Diagnostic Reading Assessment Grades 1-6</h2><p>Reading Assessment</p><p></p><h2>Inside Star Trek: The Real Story</h2><p>An insider&#39;s account of the making of the original classic television series discusses the origins and development of a cultural phenomenon, offering a fascinating look at the actors and their characters, scripts, directors, budgets, and weekly TV production. Reprint.</p><p>In the spring of 1964, a rumpled, soft-spoken ex-cop named Gene Roddenberry walked into the office of Herbert F. Solow, the new head of production at Desilu Studios. Roddenberry presented an idea for a new science fiction television series called Star Trek. Immediately seeing the show's potential, Solow struck a script development deal with Roddenberry on the spot. Soon, Solow and Roddenberry brought Robert H. Justman on board as assistant director and together the three men embarked on an incredible odyssey that would make television history. <i>Inside Star Trek</i> is a comprehensive look at the development and life of a television and cultural phenomenon. It is also a story no one else could tell. Between them, Solow and Justman had a hand in virtually every aspect of the development and production of Star Trek--from the battles with NBC and the internal conflicts with studio executives to the behind-the-scenes decisions about actors and their characters, writers, scripts, directors, budgets, and the endless details of weekly television production. Here is the simple, fascinating and accurate account of a unique television series launched against astronomical odds&#x2039;a series that transported millions of viewers into another world and into an unprecedented, thirty-year, multimedia, multibilliondollar cultural phenomenon.A highly detailed account of the Star Trek phenomenon, written with affection but without zest by two men who were instrumental in the creation and production of that innovative show. Solow was ``responsible for the sale, development and production'' of the series; Justman served as Star Trek's co- producer. Together, they offer a chatty encyclopedia chronicling nearly every aspect of how the show was made. Fans of celebrity gossip will find some interesting (although generally familiar) material. For instance, the book explores, as it must, the brilliant yet flawed character of Star Trek's creator, Gene Roddenberry, and the competition between series stars William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy. But the bulk of this volume concerns the technological and commercial aspects of producing the show. Justman and Solow recount in fervent detail how the lighting, special effects, music, costumes, scripts, and sets of the series were created. Desilu Studios, Star Trek's home, was not a wealthy operation, and the show's first season was an especially harried one. Scenes often had to be reshot because the studio's ancient arc lights popped and squealed. Only a few sets for scenes on alien planets existed; the same props were ingeniously altered for each new show. We learn, as well, about the studio personnel, about the corporate rivalries and in-fighting that typified television production in general and Desilu Studios in particular. (The anecdotes about Lucille Ball are wonderful, as are Solow and Justman's descriptions of the manic day-to-day business of producing a series.) To their credit, the authors are not mean- spirited, rarely pompous, and seldom self-righteous. Unfortunately, the narrative is listless and without a distinctive personality. The bland prose coupled with almost numbing detail make it slow going. Still, despite its flaws, Star Trek completists and fans certainly will want to read this book.

Thompson. Fearlessly, he hurls himself into each assignment, gouges out the truth, then returns with a fresh story no one else on earth could write. From Nixon to napalm, Las Vegas to Watergate, Carter to cocaine, hippies to himself, Thompson's razor-sharp insight and crystal clarity capture the crazy, hypocritical, degenerate, and redeeming aspects of the explosive and colorful '60s and '70s. Thompson is a rebel and an artist, and we are all richer for it.<br>"No other reporter reveals how much we have to fear and loathe, yet does it so hilariously."<br>-- Chicago Tribune</p><p>In addition to being a testament to the undeniably beatifying properties of American excess--literary, political, chemical, you name it--Hunter Thompson is the high priest of the ad hominem attack. Anyone unlucky enough to get in the way of his satirical sledgehammer will end up with soup for brains. Still, even Thompson needs a good villain to get properly lathered up; that's why he peaked simultaneously with America's 37th president, Richard Milhous Nixon. Tricky Dick was Thompson's dark-jowled, pale-calved Muse, and with his departure Thompson seemed to lose his place a bit. Swatting flies with a baseball bat. <p> You need look no further for this writer's best: this collection of pieces, first published in 1979, spans all of Thompson's primo era, including short pieces and selections from longer works. <i>The Great Shark Hunt</i> sports a few articles filed by a pre-Gonzo Hunter S. Thompson, which show flickers of passion but no real fire; the first experiments with the author's drug-fueled brand of journalism at the Kentucky Derby; and finally the gigs that made him an American institution, in Las Vegas and on the 1972 campaign trail.</p><p> Thompson's style is so unique that a reader is tempted to think that he leapt, fully formed, into Gonzohood. However, along with the crazy, careening prose itself, one of the auxiliary pleasures of <i>The Great Shark Hunt</i> is the map that it gives of Thompson's ascent (or descent, if you prefer) from the workaday hyperbole of sports writing to the hell-blast vigor of his later work.

Latin Christendom found a new confidence which has left its mark upon the landscape in the form of the great cathedrals and castles, while thousands of new towns and villages were founded. The continent was carved up into dynastic kingdoms and principalities from which the European state system would evolve. An age of great religious enthusiasm, it developed a darker side in the form of the Crusades and the persecution of heretics and Jews.<br><br>In this book seven experts in the field examine how Europe was transformed in the Central Middle Ages. Thematic chapters analyse the political, social, economic, religious and intellectual history of Latin Christendom, and trace its expansion to the north, south and east. As well as many familiar topics the authors discuss less well known aspects of the period such as the popular experience of religion or the new kingdoms of east-central Europe. The book includes a chronology of developments, a glossary, maps, illustrations and guidance for further reading.<br></p><p><br>Daniel Power is Lecturer in Medieval History at the University of Sheffield.<br>An excellent commentary...it will do very well indeed * The English Historical Review * For Weiler&#39;s and Berend&#39;s contributions alone it is well worth the paperback price * The English Historical Review * He [Power] has assembled a distinguished and thoroughly expert team of contributors...all of them survey their topics with authority, and all have important and interesting things to say. * The English Historical Review * It provides an ideal preface for those who have read no political narrative of the period, and a bracing tonic and corrective for those of us who have read far too much. * R.

Was this an accident? Or murder? The mystery deepens when clues link the girl to a double homicide committed ten years earlier. Braddon&#39;s sensational novel takes us to the estates of aristocrats, the haunts of tabloid writers, the homes of Bohemian artists, and the dark alleyways of Paris. Braddon, one of Victorian England&#39;s best-selling novelists, is at the height of her powers in Wyllard&#39;s Weird. The novel shakes the foundations of 19th-century social order as it questions the sanctity of marriage and exposes the vices hidden beneath masks of gentility. First published in 1885, Wyllard&#39;s Weird has been for too long either out of print or available only in expensive facsimile editions. The novel holds an important place in literary history as it forecasts the appearance of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in 1886 and Sherlock Holmes in 1887.</p><p></p><h2>Thinkers of the East</h2><p>A collection of short stories to illustrate Sufism - the belief that deep intuition is the only real guide to knowledge.</p><p>As the urgency of our global situation becomes apparent, more and more readers are turning to the books of writer Idries Shah as a way to train new capacities and new ways of thinking.

By articulating the philosophical underpinnings of anarchist thought on issues of human nature, freedom, authority, and social change, the case is made that the anarchist tradition can be a rich source of insights into perennial philosophical questions about education. This theoretical exploration is then bolstered with a historical account of anarchist education, focusing on key defining features of anarchist schools, their ideological underpinnings, and their pedagogical approaches. Finally, a clear explanation of how anarchist education is distinct from libertarian, progressive, Marxist, and liberal models defines the role of anarchist education in furthering and sustaining a just and equal society.</p></p><p><p><strong>Judith Suissa is a senior lecturer in philosophy of education at the Institute of Education, University of London.

How can we avoid the conventional opposition of mythology and the dawn of reason and instead explore the multiple styles of thought that emerged between them? In this acclaimed book, available in English for the first time, Maria Michela Sassi reconstructs the intellectual world of the early Greek "Presocratics" to provide a richer understanding of the roots of what used to be called "the Greek miracle."</p><p>The beginnings of the long process leading to philosophy were characterized by intellectual diversity and geographic polycentrism. In the sixth and fifth centuries BC, between the Asian shores of Ionia and the Greek city-states of southern Italy, thinkers started to reflect on the cosmic order, elaborate doctrines on the soul, write in solemn Homeric meter, or, later, abandon poetry for an assertive prose. And yet the Presocratics, whether the Milesian natural thinkers, the rhapsode Xenophanes, the mathematician and "shaman" Pythagoras, the naturalist and seer Empedocles, the oracular Heraclitus, or the inspired Parmenides, all shared an approach to critical thinking that, by questioning traditional viewpoints, revolutionized knowledge.</p><p>A unique study that explores the full range of early Greek thinkers in the context of their worlds, the book also features a new introduction to the English edition in which the author discusses the latest scholarship on the subject.</p></p><p><p>"This elegant study shows how a variety of historical, social, and cultural questions and factors eventually led to the formation of a new discipline called &#x2018;philosophy&#x2019; in ancient Greece. Sassi displays an admirable blend of anthropological and philosophical sensitivity that is perfectly adapted to the subject and illuminates it in many new ways."<b>--Andr� Laks, author of <i>The Concept of Presocratic Philosophy</i></b></p><p> "This book is among the most illuminating contributions to the much-debated topic of how, why, and in what form the Greeks of the sixth and fifth centuries BC created philosophy. Its constructive blend of cultural history, anthropology, and philosophical analysis makes it particularly good to think with, and it is now finally available to a broader audience of Anglophone readers."<b>David Sedley, University of Cambridge</b></p><p> "This impressively learned book contributes to longstanding debates about the beginnings of Greek philosophy, its connections to earlier Greek writings that address similar topics, the way Aristotle shapes our access to Presocratic philosophy, and more."<b>Katja Maria Vogt, Columbia University</b></p><p> "Avoiding the main pitfalls that beset her subject, Sassi looks afresh at the evidence for important early Greek thinkers, asks what can be attributed to them, and admirably allows for a great variety of responses to that question."<b>Geoffrey Lloyd, Needham Research Institute</b></p><b>Maria Michela Sassi </b>teaches the history of ancient philosophy at the University of Pisa.

The editors &#x2013; leaders in their field &#x2013; have drawn together more than fifty noted experts from around the world, to canvas the relevant literature from historical, conceptual, empirical and clinical perspectives. The result documents the impressive gains made over the past ten years in understanding multiple aspects of the interface between trauma, dissociation and psychosis. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The historical/conceptual section clarifies the meaning of the terms dissociation, trauma and psychosis, proposes dissociation as central to the historical concepts of schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder, and considers unique development perspectives on delusions and the onset of schizophrenia. The empirical section of the text compares and contrasts psychotic and dissociative disorders from a wide range of perspectives, including phenomenology, childhood trauma, and memory and cognitive disturbances, whilst&nbsp;the clinical section focuses on the assessment, differential diagnosis and treatment of these disorders, along with proposals for new and novel hybrid disorders. This important resource:</p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Offers extensive updated coverage of the field, from all relevant perspectives</p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brings together in one text contributions from scholars and clinicians working in diverse geographical and theoretical areas</p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helps define and bring cohesion to this new and important field</p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Features nine new chapters on: conceptions of trauma, dissociation and psychosis, PTSD with psychotic features, delusions and memory, trauma treatment of psychotic symptoms, and differences between the diagnostic groups on hypnotizability, memory disturbances, brain imaging, auditory verbal hallucinations and psychological testing</p> <p>Written for clinicians, researchers and academics in the areas of trauma, child abuse, dissociation and psychosis, but relevant for&nbsp;psychiatrists, psychologists and psychotherapists working in any area, the revised second edition of <i>Psychosis, Trauma and Dissociation</i> makes an invaluable contribution to this important evolving field.</p></p><p><p><b>The Editors</b> </p><p><b>Andrew Moskowitz, PhD,</b> Professor of Psychology, Dean of Undergraduate Programs, Touro College Berlin, Berlin, Germany. </p><p><b>Martin J.

While there he took pictures of gas stations, cars and children playing. Revealing the photographer's delight in the uncelebrated and the everyday, these four subjects appear repeatedly, from different distances and varying points of view. Later dry-mounted into a hand-made, spiral-bound album titled <i>An Afternoon in Astoria</i> in neatly printed letters, Burckhardt's photographic sequences take the viewer on a semi-narrative walk through a quiet, spread-out neighborhood, far away from everything. More than 60 years after its creation, <i>An Afternoon in Astoria</i> is now finally made available to an audience larger than the photographer, his family, and his friends. Printed to capture the unassuming nature of the original album, with its careful, filmic sequencing of photographs mounted on neutral gray board, this volume celebrates a long-ago afternoon spent in the borough of Queens, the temporary new home of The Museum of Modern Art, New York.</p><p>Rudolph Burckhardt was born in 1914 in Basel to an aristocratic, intellectually distinguished family. His great-great-uncle was Jacob Burckhardt, renowned historian of the Renaissance, his grandfather a general and a judge, and his father a prominent industrialist. With an inheritance in his pocket, "Rudy" immigrated to New York from Switzerland at the age of 21, and quickly fell in with a sophisticated set of artists, actors, poets, musicians, filmmakers, and writers, including next-door neighbor Willem de Kooning. He was married first to the painter Edith Schoss and later to the painter Yvonne Jacquette. Throughout his artistic life, he made films with artists and poets across several generations, including Joseph Cornell, Edwin Denby, Red Grooms, Alex Katz, Frank O'Hara, Larry Rivers, and Anne Waldman. In 1987, The Museum of Modern Art, New York, held a retrospective of Burckhardt's films; a decade later, a major exhibition of his photography and paintings took place at the IVAM Centre Julio Gonz�les in Valencia. In addition to <i>An Afternoon in Astoria</i>, Burckhardt completed a handful of other albums, on Queens, Manhattan, Italy, and Great Spruce Head Island, Maine. Burckhardt committed suicide in 1999.</p><h2>The Piano Master Classes of Hans Von Bulow: Two Participants&#39; Accounts</h2><p><p>The renowned concert pianist and teacher Hans von B�low gave a series of piano master classes in the summers of 1884-1887. Detailed notes of the lessons by Theodor Pfeiffer, entitled Studien bei Hans von B�low, were published around the turn of the century along with a Nachtrag (Supplement) by Jos� Vianna da Motta. </p><p>Richard Zimdars has rendered Pfeiffer's and da Motta's often cryptic notes into fully understandable instructions and has transcribed the more than 250 musical examples in the original volume. Particularly valuable is an appendix containing finger exercises from a contemporaneous book by Pfeiffer, now long out of print. </p><p>B�low's teaching, which is in the Liszt tradition, is as vital today as it was almost one hundred years ago. Students, performers, and teachers have much to learn from his high standards and artistic insight.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German<p>"... This book is pleasant reading and useful to pianists of all stages of learning." &#x2014;Choice</p><br><br><p>"... Zimdars also provides a useful introduction, annotations, and six appendixes... the two authors provide a valuable record of a nineteenth-century 'Master' who spoke with total authority from and unquestioning sense that his musical values were a part of a vital, unbroken tradition extending from the time of J.S. Bach.Bulow's concerns embrace every aspect of music-making at the piano, from commonsense advice on fingering and tonal projection, to questions of style and interpretation. Because his responses to the full range of piano literature generally exhibit logic, insight, and good taste, present-day pianists will find much of value in his comments." &#x2014;Notes</p><br><br><p>"This is, indeed, a very important publication for pianists and piano students... very important comments on technical matters as fingerings, etc., as well as interpretative indications are given... Therefore it is so important to go back to the old sources and traditions, to Liszt, to Bulow, and their pupils, trying to understand the contents of musical works and the interpretative possibilities.... This book on the master classes of Hans von Bulow is a very important guide as a great pianistic tradition is conveyed to pianists and students." &#x2014;Liszt Saeculum</p><br><br><p>"... Richard Simdars has provided a valuable source whose significance is not only historical, but pedagogic: the descriptions illuminate von Bulow's magnetic musical personality from within, and highlight not only the rigorous precision, but also the spontaneous intimacy of his piano master classes.The detailed instructions, often bar by bar regarding dynamics, agogics and fingerings, form the core of the book..... Zimdars appealing, fluent translation is both interesting and correct and well conveys the beauty of its subject.... the book represents an admirable musicological achievement. It will certainly ensure that von Bulow's master classes contine to stimulate, educate and entertain pianists, muscians and all those interested in the history of musical interpretation into the next century." &#x2014;Piano Journal</p></p><h2>Machine Design: An Integrated Approach</h2><p><p> <i>For courses in Machine Design.</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>An integrated, case-based approach to machine design</b> </p> <p> <b> <i>Machine Design: An Integrated Approach</i>, 6th Edition</b> presents machine design in an up-to-date and thorough manner with an emphasis on design.

In this inspiring cookbook, acclaimed author Joyce Goldstein presents more than 120 recipes for slow-cooked soups, stews, pasta sauces, braises, roasts, and casseroles, with rich, full flavors that are unmatched by faster cooking methods. There is nothing better than slow in the kitchen when these savory favorites are bubbling on the stove or in the oven. Taking time to cook, while leaving cooks time, these dishes are amazingly easy to prepare braised pork ribs and sausages smothered in tomatoes and red wine, fennel-scented beef sauce served over polenta, hearty white bean soup with mussels, lamb stew flavored with citrus-scented olives. In a world where even fast food seems to be getting faster, here is a mouthwatering homage to putting on the brakes and dining the Italian way.</p><p>Joyce Goldstein , chef, author, and teacher, is an acknowledged expert on both Jewish and Mediterranean cooking, as revealed in such books as Enoteca (0-8118-2825-5) and her unprecedented exploration of Jewish cuisine from the diaspora begun in Cucina Ebraica (0-8118-1969-8) and Sephardic Flavors (0-8118-2662-7). She lives in San Francisco.Just when it seems there could be nothing new to say about the cuisine of Italy or the slow food movement that was born there, Goldstein dazzles with this selection of soups, stews, roasts, sauces and casseroles. Her lushly produced and impeccably researched volume explores traditional home-cooked dishes from regions not well known to American readers, such as Liguria, Abruzzi, the Marches, Apulia, Sardinia and Trentino, as well as the more familiar Tuscany, Piedmont and Sicily. In addition to staples such as lasagna and osso buco, Goldstein resurrects treasures such as Le Virt�, a farro and bean soup from the Abruzzo; Spicy Fish and Shellfish Stew from Livorno; Lamb, Fennel, and Bread Casserole from Sardinia; Beef Stew with Sweet and Hot Paprika from Trieste; and Apulian Fava Pur�e with Wild Greens. Goldstein (<i>Solo Suppers</i>; <i>Enoteca</i>; etc.) introduces each recipe with an engaging note on the history of the dish, and her thorough instructions make it clear she's accustomed to teaching as well as working in the kitchen. This beautiful volume will more than hold its own alongside recent additions to the fast-growing slow food shelf. Like Goldstein's slow-braised Calabrian Rolled Pork Shoulder, this tribute to Italy's diverse cuisine and artisanal ingredients will stand the test of time and reward home cooks with every repeat visit.

Contains a new description of the oxidation state of glass and its components based on the phase rule. Includes a new chapter on chemical durability with recent information regarding corrosion of glass and radioactive waste disposal.</p><p>Glass science has advanced rapidly over the past two decades. The structure and chemical durability of different glasses is now better understood, and far more efficient processing methods have been developed. Many of these advances were based directly on discoveries made in the 1960s, when the basic sciences were concentrated on unveiling the structural and compositional mysteries of glass. This Second Edition of Robert H. Doremus&#39;s classic, Glass Science, has been extensively revised and updated to reflect recent advances, while retaining the pedagogical structure that made its predecessor a superb tool for both teaching and professional research. Special emphasis is placed on areas of research that have been particularly active in recent years. Two new chapters have been added: one covers chemical durability (the reaction of glass with water), which includes recent work related to corrosion of glass and radioactive waste disposal: the other concerns the reaction of gasses with glass, especially oxygen. Other new or expanded discussions cover recent advances in the structure of glass, zirconium fluoride glasses, and electrical conductivity of glass. This book is a rich source of information for virtually anyone who is involved in the study, research, or production of glass. A first-rate reference, it is divided into six sections: structure and microstructure, viscosity and structural relaxation, strength, chemical properties, electrical properties, and optical properties. Glass Science is also an excellent textbook for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses in glass science or materials science.</p><h2>The Owl, The Raven, and the Dove: The Religious Meaning of the Grimms&#39; Magic Fairy Tales</h2><p>The fairy tales collected by the brothers Grimm are among the best known and most widely-read stories in western literature. In recent years commentators such as Bruno Bettelheim have, usually from a psychological perspective, pondered the underlying meaning of the stories, why children are so enthralled by them, and what effect they have on the the best-known tales (<em>Hansel and Gretel, Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, Snow White,</em> and <em>Sleeping Beauty</em>) and shows that the Grimms saw them as Christian fables. Murphy examines the arguments of previous interpreters of the tales, and demonstrates how they missed the Grimms' intention. His own readings of the five so-called "magical" tales reveal them as the beautiful and inspiring "documents of faith" that the Grimms meant them to be.<br> Offering an entirely new perspective on these often-analyzed tales, Murphy's book will appeal to those concerned with the moral and religious education of children, to students and scholars of folk literature and children's literature, and to the many general readers who are captivated by fairy tales and their meanings.<br></p><p><br>Ronald G. Murphy is George M. Roth Distinguished Professor of German at Georgetown University.<br><br>"...an itelligent, charming, and informative book." --<em> The Chesterton Review</em><p></p><br>"...lively, careful, insightful, thoughtful, and provocative--a significant contribution to fairy tale studies." --<em>Journal of American Folklore</em><p></p><br>"Grimm's fairy stories have almost never been considered from [the] perspective [of religious meaning]....Now along comes G. Ronald Murphy...ready to take the plunge into the deeps....Features a neat bit of literary detective work....My summary can only hint at the sparkling intelligence on display in Murphy's readings of the texts....He has added several dazzling layers of meaning to the tales."--Philip Zaleski, <em>First Things</em><p></p><br>"Literary and cultural analysis of the highest order....Murphy shows in this book how thrilling it can be when our understanding of familiar stories that we enjoy and routinely share with our children is carefully--and lovingly--deepened and enriched by an astute guide."--renton Times<p></p><br>"Murphy's...finding of books in the Grimms' library is significant. Many previous scholars have acknowledged that fairy tales contain `fragments of ancient faith,' and with this new information, readers can appreciate `to what degree and in what particular direction' the Grimm tales were Christianized."--<em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em><p></p><br>"Here is a fresh, erudite, and highly readable study of the beloved fairy tales of the brothers Grimm. Ronald Murphy advances our understanding of the Classical, Germanic, and Christian sources of these stories in a manner comparable to what Bruno Bettelheim did twenty five years ago from the perspective of modern psychiatry. Murphy proves that the Grimms were deeply influenced by biblical faith and that this spiritual vision is the most important key for unlocking the rich meaning of their stories. <em>The Owl, the Raven, and the Dove</em> is a book not just for the sharp tothed academic. I earnestly recommend it to parents and those who teach young people, or just anyone who loves fairy tales." -Vigen Guroian, author of <em>Tending the Heart of Virtue: How Classic Stories Awaken a Child's Moral Imagination</em><p></p><br>"Wilhelm Grimm has found a worthy modern expositor- almost a brother- in Ron Murphy, whose gifts of research, sympathetic insight, and ecumenical religious imgination mirror those of the romantic literary genius, Wilhelm himself. Father Murphy's archival discoveries have allowed him to reconstruct Wilhelm's generous religious mentality, and his new readings of the tales in view of this mindset will come as a revelation to professional students of the Grimm's tales and to the general reader alike." -Joseph Harris, Harvard University<p></p><br></p><h2>Union Soldier of the American Civil War</h2><p><p><strong>This book provides a glimpse at the lives, weapons, and equipment of these soldiers through a collection of artifacts and exacting reproductions.</strong></p> As 1862 dawned, the Civil War, the conflict that had started the year before and that most Americans thought would last only a few months, showed no signs of ending. Hundreds of thousands of men across the divided nation enlisted in state volunteer regiments that poured into the sprawling military camps around Washington, DC, Richmond, Virginia, and other strategic locations. Within a year, thousands of these courageous men had lost their lives on bloody battlefields or died in disease-ridden encampments. This book provides a glimpse at the lives, weapons, and equipment of these soldiers through a collection of artifacts and exacting reproductions. While other books examine the War Between the States from a political, tactical, or military perspective, these books focus on the day-to-day life and the human experience of the men themselves, the Union and Confederate soldiers who enlisted and often fought to the death for their beliefs and those of their home regions of the young United States.

The presentation strikes a balance between formalism and application, between abstract and concrete. The interconnections among the various topics are clarified both by the use of vector spaces as a central unifying theme, recurring throughout the book, and by putting ideas into their historical context.

The book is well written and explanations are usually clear. Lives of famous mathematicians and physicists are scattered within the book. They are quite extended, often amusing, making nice interludes. Numerous exercises help the student practice the methods introduced. ...

Unlike most existing texts with the same emphasis and audience, which are merely collections of facts and formulas, the present book is more systematic, self-contained, with a level of presentation that tends to be more formal and abstract. This entails proving a large number of theorems, lemmas, and corollaries, deferring most of the applications that physics students might be interested in to the example sections in small print. Indeed, there are 350 worked-out examples and about 850 problems. ... A very nice feature is the way the author intertwines the formalism with the life stories and anecdotes of some mathematicians and physicists, leading at their times. As is often the case, the historical view point helps to understand and appreciate the ideas presented in the text. ... For the physics student in the middle of his training, it will certainly prove to be extremely useful."</p> <p></p> <p>THE PHYSICIST</p> <p>Review by Paul Davies, Orion Productions, Adelaide, Australia</p> <p>"I am pleased to have so many topics collected in a single volume.

The world will consequently face growing scarcities of such vital renewable resources as cropland, fresh water, and forests. Thomas Homer-Dixon argues in this sobering book that these environmental scarcities will have profound social consequences--contributing to insurrections, ethnic clashes, urban unrest, and other forms of civil violence, especially in the developing world.</p><br><p> Homer-Dixon synthesizes work from a wide range of international research projects to develop a detailed model of the sources of environmental scarcity. He refers to water shortages in China, population growth in sub-Saharan Africa, and land distribution in Mexico, for example, to show that scarcities stem from the degradation and depletion of renewable resources, the increased demand for these resources, and/or their unequal distribution. He shows that these scarcities can lead to deepened poverty, large-scale migrations, sharpened social cleavages, and weakened institutions. And he describes the kinds of violence that can result from these social effects, arguing that conflicts in Chiapas, Mexico and ongoing turmoil in many African and Asian countries, for instance, are already partly a consequence of scarcity.</p><br><p> Homer-Dixon is careful to point out that the effects of environmental scarcity are indirect and act in combination with other social, political, and economic stresses. He also acknowledges that human ingenuity can reduce the likelihood of conflict, particularly in countries with efficient markets, capable states, and an educated populace. But he argues that the violent consequences of scarcity should not be underestimated--especially when about half the world's population depends directly on local renewables for their day-to-day well-being. In the next decades, he writes, growing scarcities will affect billions of people with unprecedented severity and at an unparalleled scale and pace.</p><br><p> Clearly written and forcefully argued, this book will become the standard work on the complex relationship between environmental scarcities and human violence.</p></p><p>Winner of the 2000 Lynton Keith Caldwell Prize of the American Political Science Association<p>"This is an important book. Homer-Dixon moves the arguments about environmental scarcity and violent conflict forward a big step. I doubt if much will be written about the subjects in the next ten years that does not build on it, follow out some of its leads, or try to refute it."<b>--Robert Jervis, Institute for War and Peace Studies, Columbia University</b></p><p>"Thomas Homer-Dixon has thought more deeply, reasoned more carefully, and written more coherently about the environment/scarcity/violence nexus than anyone else I know of. This is a brilliant book--must reading for anyone concerned about the human condition in the twenty-first century."<b>--John P. Holdren, Center for Science and International Affairs, John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University</b></p></p><h2>Mind As Action</h2><p>Contemporary social problems typically involve many complex, interrelated dimensions--psychological, cultural, and institutional, among others. But today, the social sciences have fragmented into isolated disciplines lacking a common language, and analyses of social problems have polarized into approaches that focus on an individual's mental functioning over social settings, or vice versa. <br>In <em>Mind as Action</em>, James V. Wertsch argues that current approaches to social issues have been blinded by the narrow confines of increasing specialization in the social sciences. In response to this conceptual blindness, he proposes a method of sociocultural analysis that connects the various perspectives of the social sciences in an integrated, nonreductive fashion. Wertsch maintains that we can use mediated action, which he defines as the irreducible tension between active agents and cultural tools, as a productive method of explicating the complicated relationships between human action and its manifold cultural, institutional, and historical contexts. Drawing on the ideas of Lev Vygotsky, Mikhail Bakhtin, and Kenneth Burke, as well as research from various fields, this book traces the implications of mediated action for a sociocultural analysis of the mind, as well as for some of today's most pressing social issues. Wertsch's investigation of forms of mediated action such as stereotypes and historical narratives provide valuable new insights into issues such as the mastery, appropriation, and resistance of culture. By providing an analytic unit that has the possibility of operating at the crossroads of various disciplines, <em>Mind as Action</em> will be important reading for academics, students, and researchers in psychology, linguistics, cognitive science, sociology, literary analysis, and philosophy.<br></p><p><br>James V. Wertsch is Professor and Chair of the Department of Education at Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri.<br><br>"For all of us in psychology (cognitive or cultural) and education, it's tempting to avoid hard to understand relationships for example, between subjective agency and objective cultural tools, internalization and appropriation, creativity and conventions. Drawing on literary theorist Kenneth Burke as well as more familiar Bakhtin and Vygotsky, Wertsch shows us why we can't either avoid these issues, or resolve them neatly on one side or the other. With rich examples from teaching and curriculum, he simply won't let us off the hook."--Courtney Cazden, <em> Harvard Graduate School of Education</em><p></p><br>"Jim Wertsch's <em>Mind as Action</em> carries the study of mind in relation to its cultural, institutional, and historical contexts into important new territory. Must reading for anyone interested in sociocultural approaches to human nature."--Mike Cole, <em>Laboratory of Comparative Human Cognition, University</em> <em>of California, La Jolla</em><p></p><br></p><h2>English Phrasal Verbs in Use Intermediate (Vocabulary in Use)</h2><p>This reference and practice book contains 70 attractive two-page units featuring approximately 1,000 phrasal verbs.

St?phane Jorisch&#39;s stunningly inventive art adds a vibrant, surprising dimension to an already unforgettable poem.</p><p>St�phane Jorisch&#39;s work has won many awards, including three Governor General&#39;s Awards for Illustration. He lives in Montreal, Quebec.PreSchool-Grade 4-Carroll's classic nonsense poem gets a fresh visual interpretation here. In a series of spreads, a child mounts his quest for the fearsome Jabberwock in an "other" world in keeping with the delicious unknown conjured up on first hearing, "'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves-." After a glimpse of the hero, the real world shows up in the form of facing oval frames-one containing the poem, the other a Victorian father-and-son read-aloud scene. But from then on, with a few lines of the poem per page, children enter a spare landscape of rattan-printed trees, postage-stamp-sized art, and full-color ink-and-watercolor creatures whose simple, almost cartoonish look echoes Edward Lear's comic sketches. The uncluttered composition of these pages leaves plenty of room for Carroll's words to do their work. Printed in uppercase, in a faintly rune-ish serif typeface, they gyre and gimble, whiffle and burble cleanly across the page. Stewart has not paid precise attention to Humpty Dumpty's explication of the poem as it originally appears in Through the Looking-Glass, but he has captured that wordmeister's affinity for conglomeration and arbitrary meaning, creating his own odd creatures to inhabit Carroll's perfect peculiarities. The slightly removed tone is maintained by a climactic twist: when the vorpal blade snicker-snacks "through and through," the beast's innards are revealed to be mechanical-clockwork springs and gears. Other illustrated editions worth considering-Graeme Base's (Abrams, 1989) signature packed pages or Jane Breskin Zalben's (Warne, 1977; o.p.) delicately detailed watercolors-hew more closely to Humpty Dumpty's definitions, but this new version is a good choice for a younger audience, nicely conveying the lighthearted mysteriousness of the poem.<br><i>Nancy Palmer, The Little School, Bellevue, WA</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Making of Ireland: From Ancient Times to the Present</h2><p>An accessible history of Ireland from the earliest records. Lydon recounts in colourful detail the waves of settlers, missionaries and invaders who have come to Ireland since pre-history and offers a long view on Irish history up to the present.</p><p>Over the last 10,000 years, Ireland has been a destination for many peoples, including Gaelic-speaking Celts, Britons, Vikings, Anglo-Saxons, and Normans. Each of these peoples has left its trace on modern Irish culture, from the Christianity of the Briton St. Patrick to the language of the Elizabethans; each has contributed its share of confusion to the still-open question of what it means to be Irish. Lydon, a professor of history at Trinity College, describes the many streams that flow into the course of Irish history, describing cultural misunderstandings and ethnic rivalries that have long pedigrees and that continue to inform Irish politics, and tracing such events as the Flight of the Earls, the Anglican ascendancy, and the emergence of the Irish Republic in the early 20th century. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>James Lydon, formerly Lecky Professor of Modern History, is Fellow Emeritus, Trinity College, Dublin.

Christianity displaced polytheism over a wide area, offering new definitions of identity and community. The Roman Empire collapsed in Western Europe to be replaced by new "Germanic" kingdoms. In the East, Byzantium emerged, while the Persian Empire reached its apogee and collapsed. Arab armies carrying the banner of Islam reshaped the political map and brought the late antique era to a close.</p> <p>This sourcebook illustrates the dramatic political, social and religious transformations of Late Antiquity through the words of the men and women who experienced them. Drawing from Greek, Latin, Syriac, Hebrew, Coptic, Persian, Arabic and Armenian sources, the carefully chosen passages illuminate the lives of emperors, abbesses, aristocrats, slaves, children, barbarian chieftains, and saints. The Roman Empire is kept at the centre of the discussion, with chapters devoted to its government, cities, army, law, medicine, domestic life, philosophy, Christianity, polytheism, and Jews. Further chapters deal with the peoples who surrounded the Roman state: Persians, Huns, northern "Germanic" barbarians, and the followers of Islam. </p> <p>This revised and updated second edition provides an expanded view of Late Antiquity with a new chapter on domestic life, as well extra material throughout, including passages that appear for the first time in English translation. Readings in Late Antiquity is the only sourcebook that covers such a wide range of topics over the full breadth of the late antique period.</p></p><p>Rice University, Texas, USA<strong>'Readings in Late Antiquity (a sizeable re-edition of an already substantial volume) is a veritable mine of bite-size and more chunky passages and extracts from a wide range of sources' </strong>&#x2013; <em>Dr Neil Christie, Journal of Medieval Archaeology</em></p><h2>Walter Benjamin: Images, the Creaturely, and the Holy (Cultural Memory in the Present)</h2><p>Arguing that the importance of painting and other visual art for Benjamin&#39;s epistemology has yet to be appreciated, Weigel undertakes the first systematic analysis of their significance to his thought. She does so by exploring Benjamin&#39;s dialectics of secularization, an approach that allows Benjamin to explore the simultaneous distance from and orientation towards revelation and to deal with the difference and tensions between religious and profane ideas. In the process, Weigel identifies the double reference of &#39;life&#39; to both nature and to a &#39;supernatural&#39; sphere as a guiding concept of Benjamin&#39;s writings. Sensitive to the notorious difficulty of translating his language, she underscores just how much is lost in translation, particularly with regard to religious connotations. The book thus positions Benjamin with respect to the other European thinkers at the heart of current discussions of sovereignty and martyrdom, of holy and creaturely life. It corrects misreadings, including Agamben&#39;s staging of an affinity between Benjamin and Schmitt, and argues for the closeness of Benjamin&#39;s work to that of Aby Warburg, with whom Benjamin unsuccessfully attempted an intellectual exchange.</p><p>Sigrid Weigel is Director of the Center for Literary and Cultural Research in Berlin."Weigel's readings, which are steeped in philological detail and hermeneutic insight, brilliantly exhibit the stakes involved in approaching Benjamin's work anew. Her impeccable sense for intertextual trajectories coupled with broad erudition not only results in sophisticated exegeses, but also amply demonstrate the continued if not urgent relevance of Benjamin's interventions for our current intellectual and cultural concerns." (John T. Hamilton)<br><br>"Weigel (director, Center for Literary and Cultural Research, Berlin) offers a meticulous exploration of the German writer Walter Benjamin's take on creaturely existence, law, sovereignty, secularization and holiness, language, and art."

Why did European leaders resort to war and why did they not end it sooner? Roger L. Ransom sheds new light on this enduring puzzle by employing insights from prospect theory and notions of risk and uncertainty. He reveals how the interplay of confidence, fear, and a propensity to gamble encouraged aggressive behavior by leaders who pursued risky military strategies in hopes of winning the war. The result was a series of military disasters and a war of attrition which gradually exhausted the belligerents without producing any hope of ending the war. Ultimately, he shows that the outcome of the war rested as much on the ability of the Allied powers to muster their superior economic resources to continue the fight as it did on success on the battlefield.</p><p>The First World War left a legacy of chaos that is still with us a century later.

In part this had to do with the common perception that private life and state socialism were at odds by definition, to the extent that the private person has no legal identity or political standing outside the socialist community. The East German regime's infamous surveillance techniques, best illustrated in the notorious exploits of the state's sprawling security force - the Stasi - and its reserve army of 'unofficial collaborators', further dramatized the full penetration of the state into the private sphere. <br><br><em>Within Walls</em> takes a different perspective. Paul Betts shows how, despite the primacy of public identities, the private sphere assumed central importance in the Gdr from the very outset, and was especially pronounced in the regime's former capital city. In a world in which social interaction was heavily monitored, private life functioned for many citizens as a cherished arena of individuality, alternative identity-formation, and potential dissent. Betts carefully charts the changing meaning of private life in the Gdr across a variety of fields, ranging from law to photography, religion to interior decoration, family living to memoir literature, revealing the myriad ways in which privacy was expressed, staged, and defended by citizens living in a communist society.</p><p><br><strong>Paul Betts</strong> taught at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, 1996-1999, and has been teaching Modern German History at the University of Sussex since 2000.

Set over two thousand years ago on the calm and fertile shores of the Black Sea, Naomi Mitchison's <i>The Corn King and the Spring Queen</i> tells of ancient civilisations where tenderness, beauty and love vie with brutality and dark magic. Erif Der, a young witch, is compelled by her father to marry his powerful rival, Tarrik the Corn King, so becoming the Spring Queen. Forced by her father, she uses her magic spells to try and break Tarrik's power. But one night Tarrik rescues Sphaeros, an Hellenic philosopher, from a shipwreck. Sphaeros in turn rescues Tarrik from near death and so breaks the enchantment that has bound him. And so begins for Tarrik a Quest - a fabulous voyage of discovery which will bring him new knowledge and which will reunite him with his beautiful Spring Queen.</p><p>A novel ahead of its time (1931) in many ways due to its quiet feminism and its insistence that women could have fun, and quest-plots, as well as men, this was acclaimed as one of the most important books of the year it was published. Mythical and historical at once, the story follows Erif Der in her journeys through the world of her time as she searches for atonement, reconciliation and cleansing. Lyrical descriptive writing, lucid treatments of politics and war and intensely intimate observation of the needs and deeds of human beings fill this book, which manages to be earthy and transcendent at once.<b>'This breathtaking recreation of life in the ancient world welds the power of myth and magic to a stirring plot.'

Auden: Prose and Travel Books in Prose and Verse, 1926-1938 (Volume 1)</h2><p><p>This book contains all the essays and reviews that W. H. Auden wrote during the years when he was living in England, and also includes the full original versions of his two illustrated travel books, <i>Letters from Iceland </i>(written in collaboration with Louis MacNeice) and <i>Journey to a War</i> (written in collaboration with Christopher Isherwood). Auden's early prose ranges from extravagant indiscreet travel diaries through sharply observed critiques of writers from John Skelton to Winston Churchill. It includes studies of Communism and Christianity; audaciously wide-ranging essays on literature, psychology, and politics; and writings about gossip, sex, prisons, and schools.</p><br><p> The editor's notes include explanations of contemporary and private allusions. The long "Last Will and Testament" written in verse by Auden and MacNeice, which Evelyn Waugh described as a "gossip column," is annotated in full. The book will interest not only Auden's many admirers, but everyone concerned with twentieth-century literature and culture.</p><br><p> About the series:</p><br><p> In 1928, Stephen Spender hand-printed thirty copies of a small volume of poems by his friend W. H. Auden--the first published book by a man who was to become the dominant literary figure of his generation and one of the century's greatest poets. Sixty years later, Princeton University Press inaugurated an edition of the complete works of Auden, which is intended to serve as the definitive text for all the works Auden published or intended to publish in the form in which he expected to see them printed: his plays and other drama, libretti, essays and reviews, and poems.</p><br><br><p> <i>The Complete Works of W. H. Auden</i> will provide a unique opportunity to solve the numerous textual problems connected with the severe revisions Auden made in his own works. The texts are newly edited from Auden's manuscripts by Edward Mendelson, the literary executor of the Auden estate.</p></p><p><b>Edward Mendelson</b> is Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University and the author of <i>Early Auden</i>.

Reprint.</p><p>The third Flight Engineer yarn seems to conclude the adventures of Peter Raeder, at least as a Star Command officer. He and convalescing Sarah James have just become lovers when the insectoid Fibians launch a major attack on Star Command bases and human-inhabited planets. Succeeding to command of <i>Invincible</i> , Raeder takes her out on an improvised reconnaissance mission and, by a freak of physics, ends up taking a Fibian prisoner. He steadily unravels the Fibians' secret, which is that they are divided into a number of clans, of which only one, the youngest and most ruthless, is allied with the fanatical human Mollies against the rest of humanity. Horrified at their cousins' penchants for recreational sex and torturing prisoners, the other Fibian clans, who may have a hivelike society but include many admirably individualized characters, ally themselves with Star Command. That ends the war, reduces Star Command strength, and leaves Raeder anticipating a new career as a freelance explorer. Without pretensions and, of its kind, nearly flawless entertainment. <i>Roland Green</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

To what extent was the use of new machines influenced by the ideas of scientific medicine and to what extent by the availability of newly structured facilities and trained personnel? Drawing on the medical treatment of more than 2,000 patients in Pennsylvania and New York hospitals, Howell traces the ways in which medical technology was used, not merely how it was talked about. He utilizes a wide range of sources&#x2015;including medical texts, popular literature, and the visual arts&#x2015;to explore how technology came to be such a central feature of medical care.</p><p>Howell also shows how changes in medical practice raised issues of gender, culture, and economics. Howell's analysis is especially timely in light of the ongoing debate over U.S. health care reform, a debate in which a central topic is the use and expense of medical technology. In a concluding chapter he applies the book's historical insights to medical practice today&#x2015;asking why, for example, modern diagnostic tests have not been used to give doctors more time to spend with patients.</p></p><p>Some time ago I started a comparative study of the use of medical technology in the hospitals in England and the United States.

Professor Baumgartner&#39;s book fills a major gap in the textbook market: an accessible, fully current account which covers the principal political, economic and cultural themes from Francois I&#39;s successful centralization of the state, through France&#39;s near prostration under the Catholic-Huguenot civil war, and ending with the accession of Henri IV.</p><p>Was France in the sixteenth century as beautiful as Fernand Braudel has described it? Or was it actually a century of &#34;blood and iron&#34; as Henry Hiller saw it? The truth is that the history of France in the sixteenth century embodies both of these interpretations. The glories of the French Renaissance, the great prosperity of the early decades, and the conquest of Calais and the Three Bishoprics of Lorraine all existed in counterpoint to the Italian wars, the wars with the Habsburgs, the French Wars of Religion, and the severe economic depression of the last decades of the era. France in the Sixteenth Century is certain to become an indispensable classic for scholars and students of French history.Frederic J.

Through decades of work in some thirty countries, he has become an international authority on sustainable management of land and water resources. Dr. Hillel has served as professor of soil physics, hydrology and the environmental sciences at leading universities in the U.S. and abroad, and has been a consultant to the World Bank and the United Nations. Among the honors he has received are the Chancellor&#39;s Medal for Exemplary Service at the University of Massachusetts , a Guggenheim award, and Doctorates of Science honoris causa by Guelph University of Canada and Ohio State University . Dr. Hillel is an elected Fellow of the American Association for Advancement of Science, the American Geophysical Union, the Soil Science Society of America, and the American Society of Agronomy and was granted the Distinguished Service Award by the latter societies. He has published well over 300 scientific papers and research reports, and authored or edited twenty two books. His definitive textbooks on environmental physics have been use by universities and research institutions throughout the world and have been translated into twelve languages."What a great textbook for students of the environmental sciences and a reference book for scientists seeking cutting-edge practical applications of theories. The author produced a very well written and organized book with historical and modern perspectives, matched with excellent graphics. WOW!"<br>- Dr. Leticia S. Sonon, Soil, Plant, and Water Laboratory, University of Georgia, Athens, USA<br><br>"As current university soil courses more and more blend agriculture and environmental issues this text will become a standard. The topics provide insightful coverage of soil in sustaining two basic human needs, a quality food supply and a livable environment, both needs on which future global dependency will rise, not diminish. This text is the right resource for the right time, it's perfect for the new type of introductory soil course appearing on college campuses."<br>- Steve Thien, Kansas State University, USA<br><br>"Soil in the Environment is an excellent introductory text addressing the importance of soils in ecosystems and the environment. It would be an outstanding choice as the text for a university core science course introducing students to soil science. Core science courses are required for all non-science students at almost all major universities and colleges as part of a well-rounded university education.<br><br>The textbook could also serve as a very good textbook for an introductory soil science course for ecologists, landscape architects, and other students who need a good exposure to the fundamentals of soil science for their future careers, but who might be overwhelmed by a comprehensive soil science text. Students taking soils related courses at community colleges could also find this textbook potentially useful.<br><br>The textbook is written in Dr. Hillel's easy to understand style and he has made liberal use of high quality figures and tables. The ample use of color figures and diagrams is partcularly striking. The author has also included blue boxed text areas throughout the book that illustrate real world practical examples of the material being discussed in that chapter. The examples included in these blue boxed areas are critically important in making the subject being discussed pertinent to students and help retain their interest when reading. There is also a well conceived and thoughtful glossary included at the end of the textbook. "<br>- Dr. Robert L. Hill, Professor of Soil Physics, Soil &amp; Water Management, Dep. of Environmental Science &amp; Technology, University of Maryland College Park, USA<br><br>"I find this book full of fascination and passion for soil knowledge. Dr. Hillel vividly depicts the importance of soil and why we should care about it while he walks us through both a general and broad understanding of soil science. I consider it the perfect tool for captivating new generations of soil scientists whom, for sure, will readily become Homo sapiens curans after this reading. This book could be used as a core text in introductory courses for non soil science students and as an additional reading for soil science students."<br>- Nadia Mart�nez-Villegas, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, USA<br><br>"All of his writings are in a crisp, straight-forward language, but in his current text, I find Dr. Hillel to be more philosophical in his approach to soil physics education. In the classroom environment and his earlier texts, he was more quantitative than philosophical; just the opposite in this one, without losing the tenor required of an introductory text in soil physics. Other than his &#x201c;Rivers of Eden book, this is the most readable text yet published on the subject. The beginning student is guided through the text with witty and interesting insights into history. He doesn&#x2019;t pass up the opportunity to give example problems for the student to work through, but the book is not overloaded with calculations, something that most beginning students in soil science might find comforting. The professor who uses this text for a basic class in soil physics will find it completely fulfilling in that subject matter, and it will also provide the students with a rich background in ecological interactions between soil, crop, population growth, and the environment. <br><br>New in this publication by Dr. Hillel, is the inclusion of appendices where he talks about the role soil plays in the mitigation of global warming (Appendix A), and the role soil plays in the global food supply (Appendix B). Both are chuck-full of useful information that is thought-provoking for tomorrow&#x2019;s leaders in soil and other sciences.<br><br>This is definitely a text for use in college soil physics classes, an excellent one for reference for horticulturists like myself, and, I would submit, any communications medium that purports to inform the public on environmental and agricultural issues with research-based information." <br>- Dr. Ronald Smith, North Dakota State University, Department of Plant Sciences, Fargo, USA<br><br>"This book provides a compact review of the material necessary for anyone interested in understanding the interaction of soils with the other components of our environment. As an excellent teaching tool, the book is organized in a logical manner beginning with the basic soil concepts, followed by topics highlighting the role of soil in the plant-water&#x2013;air ecosystems, and concluding with an overview of the impact of population growth on the world&#x2019;s agricultural soils. Students and instructors will find the glossary presented at the end of the book very useful as both a study guide and a quick reference for technical terms."<br>- Dave Goorahoo, California State University, Fresno, USA<br><br>"Soil in the Environment links soil science, environmental studies, civil engineering, geology, and life science...valuable reference for undergraduate students, [including] important issues such as global warming and climatic change, soil energy balance, and food production demand.

In this analysis of a startling cultural transformation Kristin Ross finds the contradictions of the period embedded in its various commodities and cultural artifacts&#x2015;automobiles, washing machines, women's magazines, film, popular fiction, even structuralism&#x2015;as well as in the practices that shape, determine, and delimit their uses.</p><p>In each of the book's four chapters, a central object of mythical image is refracted across a range of discursive and material spaces: social and private, textual and cinematic, national and international. The automobile, the new cult of cleanliness in the capital and the colonies, the waning of Sartre and de Beauvoir as the couple of national attention, and the emergence of reshaped, functionalist masculinities (revolutionary, corporate, and structural) become the key elements in this prehistory of postmodernism in France.</p><p>Modernization ideology, Ross argues, offered the promise of limitless, even timeless, development. By situating the rise of "end of history" ideologies within the context of France's transition into mass culture and consumption, Ross returns the touted timelessness of modernization to history. She shows how the realist fiction and film of the period, as well as the work of social theorists such as Barthes, Lefebvre, and Morin who began at the time to conceptualize "everyday life," laid bare the disruptions and the social costs of events. And she argues that the logic of the racism prevalent in France today, focused on the figure of the immigrant worker, is itself the outcome of the French state's embrace of capitalist modernization ideology in the 1950s and 1960s.</p></p><p>&#39;Fast Cars, Clean Bodies&#39; examines the crucial decade from Dien Bien Phu to the mid-1960s, when France shifted from an agrarian, insular, and empire-oriented society to a decolonized, Americanized, and fully industrial one.Kristin Ross is Professor of Comparative Literature at New York University.

It explores the extent to which rising inequalities are the mechanical consequence of changes in economic fundamentals (such as changes in technological or demographic parameters), and to what extent they are the contingent consequences of country-specific and time-specific changes in institutions. <br><br>Both the 'fundamentalist' view and the 'institutionalist' view have some relevance. For instance, the decline of traditional manufacturing employment since the 1970s has been associated in every developed country with a rise of labor-market inequality (the inequality of labor earnings within the working-age population has gone up in all countries), which lends support to the fundamentalist view. But, on the other hand, everybody agrees that institutional differences (minimum wage, collective bargaining, tax and transfer policy, etc.) between Continental European countries and Anglo-Saxon countries explain why disposable income inequality trajectories have been so different in those two groups of countries during the 1980s-90s, which lends support to the institutionalist view.<br><br>The chapters in this volume show the strength of both views. Through empirical evidence and new theoretical insights the contributors argue that institutions always play a crucial role in shaping inequalities, and sometimes preventing them, but that inequalities across age, sex, and skills often recur. From Sweden to Spain and Portugal, from Italy to Japan and the USA, the volume explores the diversity of the interplay between market forces and institutions.<br></p><p><br>Edited by Daniel Cohen, Professor of Economics, University of Paris I/Ecole normale sup�rieure, Thomas Piketty, Director of Studies, Department of Economics, EHESS, and Gilles Saint-Paul, Professor, Department of Economics, Universit� des Sciences Sociales, Toulouse<br><br>"This volume provides a range of interesting arguments that make different and often important partial contributions to the explanation of recent trends in inequality."--<em> Economic Geography</em><p></p><br>"The studies cover quite a broad set of issues affecting inequality ... The research agenda of these studies is rich and ambitious." --<em>Industrial and Labor Relations Review</em><p></p><br>"The volume has many merits.

He wrote countless stories and thirty-three plays, in some of which he performed. Several films have been made from his novels, including The Sound of Waves, Enjo which was based on The Temple of the Golden Pavilion and The Sailor Who Fell From Grace with the Sea. Among his other works are the novels Confessions of a Mask and Thirst for Love and the short story collections Death in Midsummer and Acts of Worship. The Sea of Fertility tetralogy, however, is his masterpiece. After Mishima conceived the idea of The Sea of Fertility in 1964, he frequently said he would die when it was completed.

Adopting a a consumer marketing focus, it emphasises integrating sustainability principles into both marketing theory and the practical decision making of marketing managers.</p> <p>The book shows how the complexities of sustainability issues can be addressed by marketers through a systematic step-by-step approach. The steps involve an analysis of socio-environmental priorities to complement conventional consumer research; an integration of social, ethical and environmental values into marketing strategy development; a new consumer-oriented sustainability marketing mix to replace the outmoded and producer-oriented '4Ps'; and finally an analysis of how marketing can go beyond responding to social change to contribute to a transformation to a more sustainable society. Without taking such steps, marketing will continue to drive global crises linked to climate change, poverty, food shortages, oil depletion and species extinction, instead of helping to tackle them.</p> <p>A comprehensive package of supplementary materials for this text is available at www.wiley.com/college/belz.</p> <p>View the authors blog at: www.sustainability-marketing.com</p></p><p><p>The authors have over 40 years of research experience between them and many years experience of teaching sustainability marketing concepts in the classroom.</p> <p><b>Frank-Martin Belz</b> is Professor at the Technische Universit�t M�nchen (TUM School of Management).</p> <p><b>Ken Peattie</b> is Professor at Cardiff Business School where he is also the Director of the ESRC Research Centre for Business Relationships, Accountability, Sustainability and Society (BRASS).</p></p><h2>Nana (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p><em>Nana</em> opens in 1867, the year of the World Fair, when Paris, thronged by a cosmopolitan elite, was a perfect target for Zola's scathing denunciation of hypocrisy and fin-de-si�cle moral corruption.

Protect your family and avoid probate with this bestselling guide.</b> <br><br> Death may be inevitable, but probate doesn't have to be. By creating a living trust, your property will bypass lengthy and expensive probate proceedings and go directly to the people you've designated, quickly and easily. <br><br> <i>Make Your Own Living Trust</i> explains how to create a living trust, transfer property to the trust and amend or revoke the trust at any time. Specifically, it covers how to: <br><br> <li>create various living trusts, including an AB trust (also known as a marital trust or bypass trust) <br> </li><li>transfer assets to your trust, including real estate, stocks and bonds, jewelry, art or a small business <br> </li><li>name beneficiaries for all trust property <br> </li><li>sign your document and make it legal <br> </li><li>appoint someone to manage property left to minors or young adults <br> </li><li>provide for trust property management if you become incapacitated <br> </li><li>retain absolute control over trust property while you live </li><li>register, amend, or revoke a trust<br><br> <i>Make Your Own Living Trust</i> includes all the forms you need to create your own trust, plus step-by-step instructions for filling them out.

Unfortunately, many of us still postpone this process because we hesitate to summon the outside legal assistance that's traditionally been required. The folks at Nolo Press have made it their mission to provide us with the means to complete a relatively uncomplicated official arrangement like this without lawyers, however, and their third edition of <i>Make Your Own Living Trust</i> offers hope even to the most hesitant among us. With easy-to-follow instructions, helpful worksheets, and all of the forms necessary, attorney Denis Clifford shows both individuals and couples how to avoid otherwise inevitable delays and costs by preparing on their own to transfer their property directly to their designated heirs. Clifford's method involves the creation of a "living trust," which is a basic legal entity that allows property to be simply passed along in this way immediately upon the death of the person who created it. He outlines advantages and drawbacks, and then clearly lays out the entire process. The excuses stop here. <i>--Howard Rothman</i>You can create your own [living trust] with <i>Make Your Own Living Trust</i>.

During his lifetime, Roussel's work was vociferously championed by the surrealists, but never achieved the widespread acclaim for which he yearned. <i>New Impressions of Africa</i> is undoubtedly Roussel's most extraordinary work. Since its publication in 1932, this weird and wonderful poem has slowly gained cult status, and its admirers have included Salvador Dal�--who dubbed it the most "ungraspably poetic" work of the era--Andr� Breton, Jean Cocteau, Marcel Duchamp, Michel Foucault, Kenneth Koch, and John Ashbery.</p><br><p> Roussel began writing <i>New Impressions of Africa</i> in 1915 while serving in the French Army during the First World War and it took him seventeen years to complete. "It is hard to believe the immense amount of time composition of this kind of verse requires," he later commented. Mysterious, unnerving, hilarious, haunting, both rigorously logical and dizzyingly sublime, it is truly one of the hidden masterpieces of twentieth-century modernism.</p><br><p> This bilingual edition of <i>New Impressions of Africa</i> presents the original French text and the English poet Mark Ford's lucid, idiomatic translation on facing pages. It also includes an introduction outlining the poem's peculiar structure and evolution, notes explaining its literary and historical references, and the fifty-nine illustrations anonymously commissioned by Roussel, via a detective agency, from Henri-A. Zo.</p></p><p><p>"That anyone could translate <i>Nouvelles Impressions d'Afrique</i> at all is unlikely, but that it could be done with such sparkle and brio seems downright mysterious. This version rescues Roussel's bizarre masterpiece from its status as an intriguing rumor and turns it into a valuable resource for contemporary English-speaking readers. Poets especially will be in Mark Ford's debt."<b>--John Ashbery</b></p><p>"Raymond Roussel's <i>New Impressions of Africa</i> is one of the strangest, densest, maddest, most hauntingly beautiful poems of the twentieth century. In a signal act of scholarship and linguistic finesse, the poet and critic Mark Ford--who also happens to be one of the world's prime Roussel scholars--has carried this extraordinary work across the border from French into English with exemplary skill and care.

Welcome to the world of "noir musical" films, where tormented antiheroes and hard-boiled musicians battle obsession and struggle with their music and ill-fated love triangles. Sultry divas dance and sing the blues in shrouded nightclubs. Romantic intrigue clashes with backstage careers. </p><p>In her pioneering study, <i>Music in the Shadows</i>, film noir expert Sheri Chinen Biesen explores musical films that use film noir style and bluesy strains of jazz to inhabit a disturbing underworld and reveal the dark side of fame and the American Dream. While noir musical films like <i>A Star Is Born</i> include musical performances, their bleak tone and expressionistic aesthetic more closely resemble the visual style of film noir. Their narratives unfold behind a stark noir lens: distorted, erratic angles and imbalanced hand-held shots allow the audience to experience a tortured, disillusioned perspective.</p><p>While many musicals glamorize the quest for the spotlight in Hollywood's star factory, brooding noir musical films such as <i>Blues in the Night, Gilda, The Red Shoes, West Side Story,</i> and <i>Round Midnight</i> stretch the boundaries of film noir and the musical as film genres collide. Deep shadows, dim lighting, and visual composition evoke moodiness, cynicism, pessimism, and subjective psychological points of view.</p><p>As in her earlier study of film noir, <i>Blackout: World War II and the Origins of Film Noir,</i> Biesen draws on extensive primary research in studio archives to situate her examination within a historical, industrial, and cultural context.</p></p><p><p>Some musical films use film noir style and jazz to reveal the dark side of fame and the American Dream.</p><p><b>Sheri Chinen Biesen</b> is an associate professor of radio, television, and film studies at Rowan University and author of <i>Blackout: World War II and the Origins of Film Noir</i>, also published by Johns Hopkins.</p></p><h2>Calculus: Early Vectors</h2><p>Once again keeping a keen ear to the needs of the evolving calculus community, Stewart created this text at the suggestion and with the collaboration of professors in the mathematics department at Texas A&amp;M University. With an early introduction to vectors and vector functions, the approach is ideal for engineering students who use vectors early in their curriculum. Stewart begins by introducing vectors in Chapter 1, along with their basic operations, such as addition, scalar multiplication, and dot product. The definition of vector functions and parametric curves is given at the end of Chapter 1 using a two-dimensional trajectory of a projectile as motivation. Limits, derivatives, and integrals of vector functions are interwoven throughout the subsequent chapters. As with the other texts in his Calculus series, in Early Vectors Stewart makes us of heuristic examples to reveal calculus to students. His examples stand out because they are not just models for problem solving or a means of demonstrating techniques - they also encourage students to develop an analytic view of the subject. This heuristic or discovery approach in the examples give students an intuitive feeling for analysis.</p><p>The late James Stewart received his M.S. from Stanford University and his Ph.D. from the University of Toronto. He did research at the University of London and was influenced by the famous mathematician George Polya at Stanford University. Stewart was most recently Professor of Mathematics at McMaster University, and his research field was harmonic analysis. Stewart was the author of a best-selling calculus textbook series published by Cengage Learning, including CALCULUS, CALCULUS: EARLY TRANSCENDENTALS, and CALCULUS: CONCEPTS AND CONTEXTS, as well as a series of precalculus texts.REVIEW AND PREVIEW.

Looking at the middle and southern colonies as well as at Puritan New England, Bonomi finds an abundance of religious vitality throughout the colonial years among clergy and churchgoers of diverse religious backgrounds. The book focuses on 18th-century religious activity, when churches stabilized and extended their influence to all parts of the colonies, and examines the everyday life of the clergy, the tension between religious competition and religious toleration, and the attitudes and practices of churchgoers from every rank and region. The book also explores the tightening relationship between religion and politics--especially evident in the schisms of the Great Awakening, the growth of denominational factions, and the emergence of an "ideology of dissent"--and illuminates the vital role religion played in the American Revolution. Written with grace and style, <em>Under the Cope of Heaven</em> presents a stimulating new perspective on the formative era of American religious culture.</p><p>Patricia U. Bonomi, Professor of History, New York University.<br>"An excellent contribution to the social history of colonial religion. With great skill she weaves a narrative that demonstrates the inextricable relation between religion and politics in the colonies. I heartily recommend it, and look forward to using it for many years to come in the classroom."--Mark S. Cladis, <em>Vassar College</em><p></p><br>"A good succinct study of the relation of politics and religion throughout the colonial period. Especially useful as a summary accessible to udergraduate history majors."--R.K. Donovan, <em>Kansas State University</em><p></p><br>"[A] timely and thoughtful book."--<em>New Republic</em><p></p><br>"A splendid overview of the topic of religion in the colonial period. The book is gracefully and economically written, provocative yet respectful of opposing views....Goes far toward providing a genuinely balanced account of the role of religion in the formation of the American mind."--<em>William and</em> <em>Mary Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"Her depth of scholarship and documentation will please the scholar; her relation of her topic to American history in general will please the generalist, student or lay person; and her graceful writing style will endear her to all. The book is highly recommended."--<em>History</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Introductory Readings in the Philosophy of Science</h2><p>For nearly two decades, Introductory Readings in the Philosophy of Science has distinguished itself as the standard for texts specifically designed to meet the needs of beginning students. Retaining the best essays from the first two editions, the editors have added ten important new selections to maintain this influential text&#39;s relevance for today and tomorrow. Readings cover such timely and important topics as feminism and the sciences, the effects of science on society, the natural versus the social sciences, and science and human values.

Conventions are contrasted with other kinds of regularity, and conventions governing systems of communication are given special attention.</p></p><p><b><br> </b> <p><b>David Lewis</b> (1941&#x2013;2001) was Professor of Philosophy at Princeton University.

Many of his writings are available in his <i>Collected Papers</i>.</p>"This book is my attempt at an analysis of our common, established concept of convention, so that you will recognize that it explains what you must have in mind when you say that language is governed by conventions.

The dictionary of slang and unconventional English was first published in 1937. Revised and enlarged editions appeared in 1938, 1949, 1951 and 1961. From the last of these, published in two volumes, this book has been compiled.</p><p></p><h2>Weird But True Collector&#39;s Set (Boxed Set): 900 Outrageous Facts</h2><p>At last, all those weird but true facts that kids love so much are collected in this fun-tastic set of three compact, easy to handle and fun to browse books.

Rossetti. She served as a model for them, but also shared in that artistic community, with written contributions to The Germ, a Pre-Raphaelite journal. This poem was published in 1862 and helped establish her reputation, mainly as a writer for children. She wrote poems and religious books. Illness restricted her activities, perhaps adding to the intensity of feeling in her works. --This text refers to the Paperback edition. One hundred years ago, Rossetti was Britain&#39;s most popular poet, described by Virginia Woolf as &#34;the first of our English Poetesses&#34;. &#39;Goblin Market&#39; is her best-known poem.</p><p></p><h2>Empire: The British Imperial Experience From 1765 To The Present</h2><p>The British Empire radically altered the modern world. At its height, it governed over a quarter of the human race and encompassed more than a fifth of the globe. As well as providing the British people with profits and a sense of international purpose, the Empire afforded them the opportunity to create new lives for themselves through emigration and settlement. It supplied jobs at home and overseas, encouraged national aggrandizement, and allowed experiments in social engineering. For those it ruled over, the Empire often represented arbitrary power, gunboat diplomacy, and the disruption of local customs, social structures, and government by a distant and sometimes coldly unsympathetic administration. Yet while the Empire rested ultimately upon military force and direct rule, it also pulsated with ideals ideals of freedom, democracy, and even equality.In this impressively researched and always entertaining book, the esteemed British historian Denis Judd analyzes the imperial experience from the American revolution to the present day. He examines the ways in which the British Empire affected both rulers and ruled, and the roles of significant personalities from Queen Victoria to Nelson Mandela, Cecil Rhodes to Jomo Kenyatta, Joseph Chamberlain to Mahatma GhandiWhat was so special about the &#x201d;special relationship&#x201d; between Britain and the United States? Did the maintenance of the Empire artificially prolong Britain's Great Power status? Did it encourage chauvinistic, even racist, attitudes? Were subjects better off under their own elites and leaders than under British rule? In the end, what does the balance sheet of the Empire look like?The story of Empire is central to Britain's national mythology and its sense of place in the world, and essential to an understanding of its changing role as we approach the end of the millennium. Denis Judd's fine, magisterial history does full justice to a complex and epic theme.</p><p>By the middle of the 18th century, writes English historian Denis Judd, the British empire extended around the world, so that truly, as the adage had it, the sun never set on it. Yet within years that empire began to unravel, beginning with the loss of the American colonies. (The colonies, Judd opines, were not as badly treated by the crown as they professed to have been). He examines the battles, stratagems, and intrigues that helped extend British rule so far afield, drawing into his account the contributions of the great men and women of imperial history as well as the not so great ones. The latter group, in Judd&#39;s view, misjudged the tides of popular sentiment and lost the crown many friends through violence and reaction. The historian closes his study with the election of Nelson Mandela to the presidency of South Africa, and with the arguable observation that the British did their best in governing their far-flung holdings.Denis Judd is Professor of British Imperial and Commonwealth History at the University of North London. He appears frequently on radio and is a regular reviewer for most national newspapers and literary journals.</p><h2>Science and Civilisation in China, Vol. 4: Physics and Physical Technology, Part 3: Civil Engineering and Nautics</h2><p>As Dr Needham&#39;s immense undertaking gathers momentum it has been found necessary to subdivide volumes into parts, each bound and published separately.

His books include <em>The Jargon of Authenticity</em>, <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em> (with Max Horkheimer), and <em>Aesthetic Theory</em></p><p>Negative Dialects is a phrase that flouts tradition. As early as Plato, dialectics meant to achieve something positive by means of negation; the thought figure of a &#39;negation of negation&#39; later became the succinct term. This book seeks to free dialectics from such affirmative traits without reducing its determinacy.Theodor W. Adorno (1903-69) was a founder and arguably the foremost thinker of the Frankfurt School. He worked with Max Horkheimer at the New York Institute for Social Research and later taught at the University of Frankfurt until his death in 1969. His work has proved enormously influential in sociology, philosophy and cultural theory.</p><h2>Ghetto at the Center of the World: Chungking Mansions, Hong Kong</h2><p><p>There is nowhere else in the world quite like Chungking Mansions, a dilapidated seventeen-story commercial and residential structure in the heart of Hong Kong&#x2019;s tourist district. A remarkably motley group of people call the building home; Pakistani phone stall operators, Chinese guesthouse workers, Nepalese heroin addicts, Indonesian sex workers, and traders and asylum seekers from all over Asia and Africa live and work there&#x2014;even backpacking tourists rent rooms. In short, it is possibly the most globalized spot on the planet.<br> <br> But as <i>Ghetto at the Center of the World</i> shows us, a trip to Chungking Mansions reveals a far less glamorous side of globalization. A world away from the gleaming headquarters of multinational corporations, Chungking Mansions is emblematic of the way globalization actually works for most of the world&#x2019;s people. Gordon Mathews&#x2019;s intimate portrayal of the building&#x2019;s polyethnic residents lays bare their intricate connections to the international circulation of goods, money, and ideas. We come to understand the day-to-day realities of globalization through the stories of entrepreneurs from Africa carting cell phones in their luggage to sell back home and temporary workers from South Asia struggling to earn money to bring to their families. And we see that this so-called ghetto&#x2014;which inspires fear in many of Hong Kong&#x2019;s other residents, despite its low crime rate&#x2014;is not a place of darkness and desperation but a beacon of hope.<br> <br> Gordon Mathews&#x2019;s compendium of riveting stories enthralls and instructs in equal measure, making <i>Ghetto at the Center of the World</i> not just a fascinating tour of a singular place but also a peek into the future of life on our shrinking planet.</p></p><p><b>Gordon Mathews</b> is professor of anthropology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He is the author of <i>Global Culture/ Individual Identity: Searching for Home in the Cultural Supermarket</i> and <i>What Makes Life Worth Living? How Japanese and Americans Make Sense of Their Worlds</i>, coauthor of <i>Hong Kong, China: Learning to Belong to a Nation</i>, and coeditor of several books."Hong Kong's Chungking Mansions is the most notorious flophouse in Asia. . . . The shabby tenement is today as much about global commerce as tourism. What the building should be renowned for, argues Gordon Mathews in his fluid and enjoyable field study "Ghetto at the Center of the World", is the ingenious way 'low-end globalists' eke out profits from petit arbitrage. . . . It reads like a first-rate business book."--Wall Street Journal<br><br>"In this wonderful book Gordon Mathews takes on an intriguing project: daily life as it is lived, articulated, dreamed, denied, regretted, and defended in a rather rundown but very public building in Hong Kong. The residents of Chungking Mansions are economically blocked from the rest of the city and often racially discriminated against, so how do such marginalized people survive, much less prosper? This is the conundrum at the heart of "Ghetto at the Center of the World". Mathews tackles it by providing a vivid description of the people who live their lives in the building's dimly lit hallways, restaurants, and shops, and by analyzing the larger material and political forces at work. The resulting account is as informative and revealing as it is entertaining."<br><br>--William Jankowiak, author of Sex, Death, and Hierarchy in a Chinese City</p><h2>Singing in Style: A Guide to Vocal Performance Practices</h2><p>The first historical overview of vocal performance practice and style ever published, <i>Singing In Style </i>provides an introduction to how such issues as ornamentation, vibrato, rubato, portamento, articulation, tempo, language, and accompaniment with period instruments have been handled since the seventeenth century.

Since the early 1960s, he has plumbed the regional identity of the American South, primarily centering on his early home in the Black Belt counties of Alabama, the same area documented during the Depression years by Walker Evans and James Agee in Let Us Now Praise Famous Men. <br></p><p>Christenberry's poetic elucidation of Southern vernacular landscape and architecture using the media of photography, drawing, painting, collage, sculpture, and miniaturization reveals how history, the very story of place, is at the heart of his lifelong project. By exploring universal themes relating to family, culture, nature, spirituality, memory, and aging, Christenberry underscores the continuous thread of revelation of which Eudora Welty speaks. I think, he says, that oftentimes art can make an outsider look back on something he has never been part of and make him feel like he has always been part of it.<br></p><p>This volume celebrates particularly the semester-long residency in 2005 when Christenberry returned to Alabama as a Weil Fellow in the Arts and Humanities at Auburn University Montgomery. It includes images of actual structures that no longer exist (but which Christenberry documented for decades), Brownie and large-format photographs, K-houses from his body of work about the Ku Klux Klan, dream buildings, pen and ink drawings, and studies for wall sculptures. It is a testimonial to the enduring influence of Alabama&#x2019;s Black Belt landscape on Christenberry&#x2019;s singular vision.<br><br></p></p><p><p><b>William Christenberry</b> is on the faculty at the Corcoran College of Art &amp; Design in Washington, D.C.</p><p></p><p></p>"In many ways the early art of William Christenberry is the fusion of two worlds: the familiar folkish landscape of his Hale County grandparents, and the elite world of expressionism that Prof. Mel Price ushered him into at the University of Alabama. Through both artistic styles and varied mediums Christenberry captured a world beyond lens and object, a world both disappearing and reappearing in altered form, as if two dimensions of time and history in Alabama's Black Belt were colliding, each vying for supremacy.

Practically every major artistic figure of the mid-twentieth century spent some time there: Merce Cunningham, Ray Johnson, Franz Kline, Willem and Elaine de Kooning, Robert Motherwell, Robert Rauschenberg, Dorothea Rockburne, Aaron Siskind, Cy Twombly&#x2015;the list goes on and on. Yet scholars have tended to view these artists&#x2019; time at the College as little more than prologue, a step on their way to greatness. With&nbsp;<i>The Experimenters</i>, Eva D�az reveals the importance of Black Mountain College&#x2015;and especially of three key teachers, Josef Albers, John Cage, and R. Buckminster Fuller&#x2015;to be much greater than that.<br><br> D�az&#x2019;s focus is on experimentation. Albers, Cage, and Fuller, she shows, taught new models of art making that favored testing procedures rather than personal expression. These methodologies represented incipient directions for postwar art practice, elements of which would be sampled, and often wholly adopted, by Black Mountain students and subsequent practitioners. The resulting works, which interrelate art and life in a way that imbues these projects with crucial relevance, not only reconfigured the relationships among chance, order, and design&#x2015;they helped redefine what artistic practice was, and could be, for future generations.<br><br> Offering a bold, compelling new angle on some of the most widely studied creative figures of modern times,&nbsp;<i>The Experimenters</i>&nbsp;does nothing less than rewrite the story of art in the mid-twentieth century.<br></p><p><b>Eva D�az</b> is assistant professor of art history at the Pratt Institute.<br>&#x201c;What links systems theorist and architect R. Buckminster Fuller with artistic innovators such as Josef Albers and John Cage? The answer is Black Mountain College, North Carolina. . . . As art historian Eva D�az reveals in this engrossing study, their explorations in materials, form, chance, and indeterminacy were never less than electrifying. Her sympathetic portrait of Fuller as a utopian saving the world through geodesic geometry is particularly assured.&#x201d; (<i>Nature</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Insightful. . . . What distinguishes this book is D�az&#x2019;s lucid, comprehensive explanations of the ways in which Albers, Cage, and Fuller employed experimentation, or chance, and even failure as agents to advance perception in art specifically and, more broadly, to improve society and the body politic. . . .&nbsp;Highly recommended.&#x201d; (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;With well-developed prose and a good narrative, D�az excels at providing context and content for an important story of experimentation on this campus and in subsequent locations inspired or directly impacted by the Black Mountain College approach to education.&#x201d; (<i>Journal of Southern History</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Highly enjoyable and even inspirational for anyone interested in art practice or simply the power of challenging accepted ways of thinking. . . . Reminds us that the restless spirit of experimentation is often best fostered in environments that expose the rules governing life and art before pushing us, in a collective effort, to break them.&#x201d; (<i>MAKE Literary Magazine</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Provides readers with clarity and elucidation about a college, three of its professors and an outside-the-mainstream educational experience. . . . Engaging.&#x201d; (<i>New York-Pennsylvania Collector</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Terrific. Black Mountain College has long been a lodestone for those interested in alternative educational models and in artistic innovation. Nevertheless, the major historical literature on the College still rests on largely anecdotal histories, with a tendency to jaunty optimism in lieu of criticality. There is nothing quite like <i>The Experimenters</i> out there&#x2014;not on Black Mountain College, not on art making, and not on pedagogy.&#x201d; (Judith Rodenbeck, Sarah Lawrence College)<br><br>&#x201c;By parsing three different versions of experimentation&#x2015;performed by Josef Albers, John Cage, and Buckminster Fuller&#x2015;D�az shows us how their individual efforts were part of a shared commitment to art&#x2019;s capacity to reinvent the world, to alter how we see, experience, and shape it in our own image. In the name of experimentation each of the artists suspended, if only for a moment, the metrics of failure and success, and replaced them instead with the values of intellectual pleasure, expanded sensory experiences, and aesthetic innovation. While the book is undoubtedly a historical account of a particular time and place, it is also a road map for many paths that, while not taken, still remain open.&#x201d; (Helen Molesworth, Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles)<br><br>&#x201c;In this highly evocative and well-executed study, D�az explores the innovative pedagogical practices that were developed at Black Mountain College in its heyday. Respectful of the distinct teaching methods of the College&#x2019;s most notable faculty, Diaz nonetheless finds a common experimental basis to the artworks and inventions produced by their students in the late 1940s and early 1950s. <i>The Experimenters</i> is nuanced, erudite, and intellectually wide-ranging.

What does food reveal about how we live and how we think of ourselves in relation to others? Why do people have a strong attachment to their own cuisine and an aversion to the foodways of others? In this engaging account of the crucial significance rice has for the Japanese, <i>Rice as Self</i> examines how people use the metaphor of a principal food in conceptualizing themselves in relation to other peoples. Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney traces the changing contours that the Japanese notion of the self has taken as different historical Others--whether Chinese or Westerner--have emerged, and shows how rice and rice paddies have served as the vehicle for this deliberation. Using Japan as an example, she proposes a new cross-cultural model for the interpretation of the self and other.</p></p><p><br> <p>"This is a fascinating analysis of the meaning of rice as a symbol of personal and particularly of social identity in Japanese culture."<b>--Robert N.

MURTAGH has held pivotal positions in the field of historic preservation for more than 30 years. He has served as first Keeper of the National Register of Historic Places, Department of the Interior, and has been Vice President of the National Trust for Historic Preservation and President of the Victorian Society in America. He directed the Preservation Program at Columbia University, and initiated Preservation programs at the University of Maryland and the University of Hawaii.Since 1812, when architect Robert Mills drew up plans for rebuilding the steeple of Independence Hall, the impulse to preserve historic American sites and buildings has snowballed. Today tens of thousands of buildings and some 5000 historic districts are recognized by the federally coordinated National Register of Historic Places. In part an illustrated historical survey, in part a handbook for civic activists, this primer by the first Keeper of the National Register of Historic Places traces the shift in the preservation movement from the restoration of isolated landmarks and houses where "Washington slept," to an emphasis on outdoor museums (Old Salem, N.C.; Sturbridge Village, Mass.) and, in recent years, a concern for the neighborhood in which a building stands. Through a case study of the Historic Savannah Foundation, which has saved some 1000 buildings in that city, Murtagh illustrates how the public can treat the built environment as a conservable national resource. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>History of Japanese Art</h2><p>Explores the ceramics, sculpture, paintings, and furniture of Japan while explaining the historical influences of each period.</p><p>A comprehensive, extensively-illustrated, detailed overview of Japanese art -- from the Joman period (10,500 B.C.E. to 300 B.C.E.) through World War II.<p> Japanese art, like so many expressions of Japanese culture, is fascinatingly rich in its contrasts and paradoxes.

The industry has become more international and increasingly castings are being made in developing industrial countries either for internal use or for export. International companies,<br>particularly the large automotive companies, source their castings in many countries, wherever quality and price are competitive. The aim of the Foundryman's Handbook is to provide a practical reference book for all those concerned with making castings<br>in any of the commonly used alloys, by any of the usual moulding methods. International SI units are used throughout, but in almost all cases conversions to the more familiar Metric and Imperial units are given. Wherever possible, Casting Alloy<br>Specifications include equivalent specifications for several countries as well as international specifications. Individual chapters cover the casting of light alloys, copper-based alloys, all types of cast-iron and steel. For each group of alloys,<br>specifications and typical applications are described, together with details of melting practice, metal treatment and casting practice. Sand moulding materials, including green sand and chemically bonded sands are also included. Since the last edition<br>was written there have been many major technical developments including new sand binders, the rotary degassing of aluminium alloys, the adoption of metal filtration of castings and widespread use of computers for the optimisation of feeder design. The<br>use of solidification simulation by computer is becoming a useful tool for the practical foundryman. These developments have necessitated re-writing the handbook almost completely, however the layout of the previous edition has been followed as far as<br>possible.<br></p><p>The aim of the &#39;Foundryman&#39;s Handbook&#39; is to provide a practical reference book for all those concerned with making casting in any of the commonly used alloys, by any of the usual moulding methods.

James H. Johnson recreates the experience of audiences during these rich decades with brio and wit. Woven into the narrative is an analysis of the political, musical, and aesthetic factors that produced more engaged listening. Johnson shows the gradual pacification of audiences from loud and unruly listeners to the attentive public we know today.<br><br>Drawing from a wide range of sources&#x2015;novels, memoirs, police files, personal correspondence, newspaper reviews, architectural plans, and the like&#x2015;Johnson brings the performances to life: the hubbub of eighteenth-century opera, the exuberance of Revolutionary audiences, Napoleon's musical authoritarianism, the bourgeoisie's polite consideration. He singles out the music of Gluck, Haydn, Rossini, and Beethoven as especially important in forging new ways of hearing. This book's theoretical edge will appeal to cultural and intellectual historians in many fields and periods.</p><p>This book grew from a simple question. Why did French audiences become silent? Eighteenth-century travelers&#39; accounts of the Paris Opera and memoirs of concertgoers describe a busy, preoccupied public, at times loud and at others merely sociable, but seldom deeply attentive.<b>James H.

Over the past decade, an exciting science has emerged that seeks to narrow the gap between the discovery of new knowledge and its application in public health, mental health, and health care settings. Dissemination and implementation (D&amp;I) research seeks to understand how to best apply scientific advances in the real world, by focusing on pushing the evidence-based knowledge base out into routine use.<br><br>To help propel this crucial field forward, leading D&amp;I scholars and researchers have collaborated to put together this volume to address a number of key issues, including: how to evaluate the evidence base on effective interventions; which strategies will produce the greatest impact; how to design an appropriate study; and how to track a set of essential outcomes. D&amp;I studies must also take into account the barriers to uptake of evidence-based interventions in the communities where people live their lives and the social service agencies, hospitals, and clinics where they receive care.<br><br>The challenges of moving research to practice and policy are universal, and future progress calls for collaborative partnerships and cross-country research. The fundamental tenet of D&amp;I research-taking what we know about improving health and putting it into practice-must be the highest priority.

Even before then, the conflicts it causes in the Middle East and elsewhere will be frighteningly exacerbated.</p><p>The alternative exists: renewable energy from renewable sources - above all, solar. Substituting renewable for fossil resources will take a new industrial revolution to avert the worst of the damage and establish a new international order. It can be done, and it can be done in time. </p><p><em>The Solar Economy</em>, by one of the world's most effective analysts and advocates, lays out the blueprints, showing how the political, economic and technological challenges can be met using indigenous, renewable and universally available resources, and the enormous opportunities and benefits that will flow from doing so.</p></p><p>Hermann Scheer is a Member of Parliament for the German government, the Deutscher Bundestag.

In <i>Phishing for Phools</i>, Nobel Prize&#x2013;winning economists George Akerlof and Robert Shiller deliver a fundamental challenge to this insight, arguing that markets harm as well as help us. As long as there is profit to be made, sellers will systematically exploit our psychological weaknesses and our ignorance through manipulation and deception. Rather than being essentially benign and always creating the greater good, markets are inherently filled with tricks and traps and will "phish" us as "phools."</p><p><i>Phishing for Phools</i> therefore strikes a radically new direction in economics, based on the intuitive idea that markets both give and take away. Akerlof and Shiller bring this idea to life through dozens of stories that show how phishing affects everyone, in almost every walk of life. We spend our money up to the limit, and then worry about how to pay the next month's bills. The financial system soars, then crashes. We are attracted, more than we know, by advertising. Our political system is distorted by money. We pay too much for gym memberships, cars, houses, and credit cards. Drug companies ingeniously market pharmaceuticals that do us little good, and sometimes are downright dangerous.</p><p><i>Phishing for Phools</i> explores the central role of manipulation and deception in fascinating detail in each of these areas and many more. It thereby explains a paradox: why, at a time when we are better off than ever before in history, all too many of us are leading lives of quiet desperation. At the same time, the book tells stories of individuals who have stood against economic trickery&#x2015;and how it can be reduced through greater knowledge, reform, and regulation.</p></p><p><p>"In an entertaining and lively account, Akerlof and Shiller show that while the pursuit of profits may lead to products that enrich our lives, it may also lead to manipulation and deception. Much of recent innovation has led to products that make cheating the public easier. The implications are complex and profound."<b>--Joseph E. Stiglitz, Nobel Laureate in Economics</b></p><p>"<i>Phishing for Phools</i> is an intellectual tour de force. It may change your image of the invisible hand into an invisible phoot, always looking to trip you up. Read it for phun; read it for wisdom."<b>--Alan S. Blinder, author of <i>After the Music Stopped: The Financial Crisis, the Response, and the Work Ahead</i></b></p><p>"A phabulous book! This is economics after the behavioral revolution at its best."<b>--Samuel Bowles, Santa Fe Institute</b></p><p>"Akerlof and Shiller provide a phenomenal guide to the pitfalls of the phree market. This redemptive revision of economic theory explains the built-in risks of rip-offs in a profit-maximizing world."<b>--Nancy Folbre, professor emerita, University of Massachusetts, Amherst</b></p><p>"As Akerlof and Shiller remind us, the same incentives that lead sellers to introduce innovations that improve quality and reduce costs also ensure that no profitable opportunity to cheat us will remain unexploited. This highly readable and insightful book will transform how we think about the role of government."<b>--Robert H. Frank, author of <i>The Economic Naturalist</i></b></p><p>"Akerlof and Shiller extend the standard &#x2018;market failure' theory--which says that there is a potential role for government intervention when markets fail--by showing that markets fail not only because of the familiar reasons of externalities and unfair income distribution, but also because of the pervasive phenomenon of &#x2018;phishing for phools' (profit-seeking through manipulation and deception). They point the way to a new paradigm freed from the constraints of market failure theory, able to illuminate &#x2018;control <i>by</i> capital' (partly through phishing) and to prescribe for &#x2018;control <i>of</i> capital' (partly by techniques for limiting phishing suggested here)."<b>--Robert H. Wade, London School of Economics</b></p><p>"This insightful book exposes a fundamental contradiction in the market system. Consumers and policymakers beware: profit-seeking businesses foster efficiency and innovation, but have strong incentives to manipulate you and sophisticated new data tools allow them to do so in personalized ways."<b>--Laura D'Andrea Tyson, University of California, Berkeley</b></p><p>"This fun but serious book tells how the standard story about free markets often gets it wrong. Indeed, Akerlof and Shiller suggest that we should drop the view of markets as generally benign institutions. The argument is laid out with the help of fascinating anecdotes, the language is conversational, and the book is easy to read. It is addressed to a broad audience, but economists will enjoy it too."<b>--Dani Rodrik, author of <i>The Globalization Paradox</i></b></p><p>"<i>Phishing for Phools</i> is a coherent and highly plausible explanation of why markets--although usually beneficial--can lead to undesirable outcomes. The book takes an intriguing approach and gives many interesting examples."<b>--Diane Coyle, author of <i>GDP: A Brief but Affectionate History</i></b></p><b>George A.

We all know the outline of the story&#x2014;how otherwise sensible merchants, nobles, and artisans spent all they had (and much that they didn&#x2019;t) on tulip bulbs. We have heard how these bulbs changed hands hundreds of times in a single day, and how some bulbs, sold and resold for thousands of guilders, never even existed. Tulipmania is seen as an example of the gullibility of crowds and the dangers of financial speculation. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it wasn&#x2019;t like that. As Anne Goldgar reveals in <i>Tulipmania</i>, not one of these stories is true. Making use of extensive archival research, she lays waste to the legends, revealing that while the 1630s did see a speculative bubble in tulip prices, neither the height of the bubble nor its bursting were anywhere near as dramatic as we tend to think. By clearing away the accumulated myths, Goldgar is able to show us instead the far more interesting reality: the ways in which tulipmania reflected deep anxieties about the transformation of Dutch society in the Golden Age.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;Goldgar tells us at the start of her excellent debunking book: &#x2018;Most of what we have heard of [tulipmania] is not true.&#x2019;. . . She tells a new story.&#x201d;&#x2014;Simon Kuper, <i>Financial Times</i></p><p><b>Anne Goldgar</b> is reader in early modern history at King&#x2019;s College, London. She is the author of <i>Impolite Learning: Conduct and Community in the Republic of Letters, 1680&#x2013;1750</i>.<p>&#x201c;<i>Tulipmania</i> is in every way a model of historical scholarship, an exemplary piece of historical craftsmanship. Every page is rife with rich human detail, and Goldgar&#x2019;s lively and elegant style carries the reader, enthusiasm and curiosity undimmed, to the stimulating conclusion. Above all, this is revisionist history of the best kind.&#x201d;</p> (Anthony Grafton, Princeton University)<br><br><p>"This is wonderful book, beautifully written and sustained by archival scholarship of the highest order. Its devastating and original demolition of the myth of Tulip mania, the fineness of historical judgment and the painstaking reconstructions so effortlessly conveyed on the page make it a pleasure to read."</p> (John Brewer, author of A Sentimental Murder: Love and Madness in the Eighteenth Century)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Anne Goldgar&#x2019;s scholarly sleuthing gives a whole new look to the 1630s tulipmania in the Netherlands.The bulb buyers and sellers were good middle-class merchants, not so far removed from knowledgeable connoisseurs and art-lovers.&nbsp;The crash in prices undermined not the economy, but people's confidence in honor and good judgment.&nbsp;Delightfully written, <i>Tulipmania</i> turns the exaggerations of a media event into an exploration of early modern values and anxieties.&#x201d;</p> (Natalie Zemon Davis)<br><br>"In this handsomely illustrated volume. . . . Goldgar provides a rich survey of the historiography of early modern European cultural and financial history along with a detailed account of the rise of tulip connoisseurship and trade. Some readers may find her interpretation&#x2014;that participants in the tulip market were motivated more by connoisseurship and honor than pursuit of gain&#x2014;to be overly subtle, but most will be impressed by Goldgar's thoroughness in examining primary sources. Highly recommended." (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>"Goldgar tells us at the start of her excellent debunking book: 'Most of what we have heard of [tulipmania] is not true' . . . . She tells a new story." (Simon Kuper <i>Financial Times</i>)<br><br>"A standard reference for all historians whenever they deal with this episode in Dutch financial history." (Larry Neal <i>EH.Net</i>)<br><br>"What Anne Goldgar does in her provocative and lively new book is convincingly cast all of these existing narratives into questions. Drawing on extensive research in a wide range of archives . . . she shows that the tulip boom, far from representing a case of mass irrationality, was actually the product of intellectual, familial, and commercial networks among a relatively small and prosperous subset of Dutch burghers. . . . [The book] serves not only to rewrite a fascinating historical event, but to shed considerable light on the history or early modern commerce and culture more generally." (Alix Cooper <i>Renaissance Quarterly</i>)<br><br>"A brilliant young spoilsport of a historian . . . decided to examine the evidence rather than buy the legend. . . . This book is a gem. Elegantly and lucidly written, it debunks the myth of tulipmania once and for all." (Richard Mawrey <i>Historic Gardens Review</i>)<br><br>"In my view it is a wonderful and delightfully written book offering a totally new slant on the tulipmania in the Netherlands in the 1630s, when the bottom dropped out of the tulip bulb market in just a few days&#x2019; time."<p></p> (M.M.G. Fase <i>De Economist</i> 2008-02-12)<br><br>"A meticulously researched study of the phenomenon that challenges all of the previously held ideas about the extent of this bubble. There can be no doubt that this well-written and engaging book will become the standard reference on the topic for years to come." (Donald J. Harreld <i>H-Net Reviews</i>)</p><h2>Granite</h2><p>Susan Butcher was a four-time champion of the Iditarod Trail sled dog race. Granite was her greatest lead dog, but he didn&#x20ac;&#x2122;t start that way. He was a shy, scraggly pup that the others pushed around, but Susan saw his potential. Together they worked until he became leader of the team.While they were training for the Iditarod, Granite became deathly ill. The veterinarians said he would never be strong enough to run the race. Granite refused to accept this, and slowly he started to recover. By the time of the race he was strong enough to start, but Susan wondered if he could finish the entire thousand-mile race. Confidently Granite guided the team into the lead of the race, when suddenly they were caught in a raging Arctic blizzard. Now Susan and the whole team depended on Granite to get them through the storm. He had to call on all his inner strength and courage to save them&#x20ac;&#x201d;if he could.</p><p><b>Susan Butcher and David Monson</b> were married for twenty-one years. Together they raised and trained the dogs of Trail Breaker Kennel and achieved many vicotires in major sled dog races around the world. Susan won the Iditarod four times and finished in the top ten fifteen times. Granite was her lead dog for many of these races. She took a dog team to the summit of Denali, the highest peak in North America-this feat has never been repeated. David won the Yukon Quest in 1988 and he and Susan ran the Iditarod together three times.&nbsp;In August 2006, Susan died of leukemia. David lives in Fairbanks, Alaska, with their daughters, Tekla and Chisana. The three of them continue Susan's legacy of raising and training sled dogs, many of which are descendants of Granite.&nbsp;<b>Sarah Douglas </b>moved to Alaska in 1989 to work as a river guide and instantly felt that she had found her true home.

His writings&#x2014;brilliant forerunners of the modern essay&#x2014;reflect his thoughts and opinions on poetry, philosophy, theology, law, literature, education, and world exploration. Highly readable works written in a lively, conversational style, Montaigne's essays are journeys of self-discovery, created by the author to determine whether his views were formed through external forces or his own nature. Filled with aphorisms and anecdotes and enlivened by word play and a delightful folksiness, they are frank and unbiased, and ultimately, a celebration of literacy, friendship, and the love of life. <br>Here are seven of Michel de Montaigne's influential essays, presented in a unique dual-language format. An expert blend of intellect and personal storytelling, these works remain popular around the world and are essential reading for students of French language, literature, and culture. Introduction, new English translations, and Notes by Stanley Appelbaum.</p><p>Michel de Montaigne (1533-1592) was one of the most influential writers of the French Renaissance and the originator of the genre of the essay.</p><h2>Serpent of the Nile: Women and Dance in the Arab World</h2><p>A celebration of the female dancers of the Arab world and their impact on the West, this book explains the origins of this ancient art, which has survived in the face of commercialism, religious disapproval and changing times. Focusing on the 19th- and early-20th centuries, the book shows how Arabic dance came to be influenced by Western ideas about art and entertainment. But the influence was two-way. In the heyday of Orientalism, Arabic dance exerted a powerful influence on the Western imagination - on such writers and artists as Flaubert, David Robers and Jean-Leon Gerome, and imitators Colette and Mata Hari. Their fascination was often based on common fantasies about the women of the Middle East. Yet, as the book&#39;s illustrations show, this obsession also produced evocative images. At the turn of the century, the genre also had an impact on fashion, theatre and popular entertainment.</p><p>Wendy Buonaventura is an Anglo-Italian dancer and writer. Her first book on Oriental dance was published in London in 1983.Serpent of the Nile was chosen as The Observer Book of the Year. She has also written and presented programmes for the BBC World Service. She has pioneered the development of Arabic dance as a theatre art in the West and her work has been featured at festivals throughout Europe and in the United States.'A delight to browse through and just as interesting to read...sumptuously illustrated.'

The contributors analyze the contradiction between globalizing and territorially based social and political forces in the context of past, present, and future world orders, and view the emerging world order as undergoing a structural transformation, a &#34;triple crisis&#34; involving economic, political and &#34;socio-cultural&#34; change. The prevailing trend of the 1980s and early 1990s toward the marketization and commodification of social relations leads the contributors to argue that socialism needs to be redefined away from the totalizing visions associated with Marxism-Leninism, toward the idea of the self defense of society and social choice to counter the disintegrating and atomizing effects of globalizing and unplanned market forces.</p><p>Relating the writings of Antonio Gramsci and others to the contemporary reconstruction of historical materialist theories of international relations, the contributors argue that the emerging world order is undergoing a &#34;triple crisis&#34; involving economic, political and &#34;socio-cultural&#34; change.Stephen Gill is Distinguished Research Professor of Political Science, York University, Toronto and a former Distinguished Scholar in International Political Economy of the International Studies Association.

While most scholars have pointed to the impact of military or capitalist revolutions, Philip S. Gorski argues instead for the importance of a disciplinary revolution unleashed by the Reformation. By refining and diffusing a variety of disciplinary techniques and strategies, such as communal surveillance, control through incarceration, and bureaucratic office-holding, Calvin and his followers created an infrastructure of religious governance and social control that served as a model for the rest of Europe&#x2014;and the world.</p></p><p><b>Philip S.

Based on these results, the authors have created a simple seven-step lifestyle plan that involves regular blood donation, extra fluids, and sensible lifestyle strategies.</p></p><p><p>For years, we've been hearing about a variety of factors related to heart disease: having high cholesterol, being overweight, eating saturated fat, having diabetes, and even the latest, having high homocysteine levels. But none of these has been proven to directly cause the hardening and clogging of the arteries. In this revolutionary book, cardiologist Kenneth R. Kensey, M.D., takes a fresh look at the real cause of artery hardening: damage to the artery lining caused by overly forceful blood flow. The well-researched solution? Thinning and "softening" the blood so that it flows smoothly throughout the body.</p> <p>Dr. Kensey provides an easy-to-follow, seven-step lifestyle plan for creating "thinner" blood and preventing artery damage from occurring or worsening. The plan is simple, involving regular blood donation, extra fluids, a sensible diet, and exercise.

Winner of the 1961 Newbery Medal,&nbsp;<i>Island of the Blue Dolphins</i>&nbsp;tells the story of a girl left alone for eighteen years in the aftermath of violent encounters with Europeans on her home island off the coast of Southern California. This special edition includes two excised chapters, published here for the first time, as well as a critical introduction and essays that offer new background on the archaeological, legal, and colonial histories of Native peoples in California.&nbsp;Sara L. Schwebel explores the composition history and editorial decisions made by author Scott O&#x2019;Dell that ensured the success of&nbsp;<i>Island of the Blue Dolphins</i>&nbsp;at a time when second-wave feminism, the civil rights movement, and multicultural education increasingly influenced which books were taught. This edition also considers how readers might approach the book today, when new archaeological evidence is emerging about the &#x201c;Lone Woman of San Nicolas Island,&#x201d; on whom O&#x2019;Dell&#x2019;s story is based, and Native peoples are engaged in the reclamation of indigenous histories and ongoing struggles for political sovereignty.</p><p>&#x201c;In this fascinating and engaging book, Sara L.

If the experience of most black Americans says otherwise, an explanation has been sorely lacking&#x2014;or obscured by the passions the issue provokes. At long last offering a cool, clear, and informed perspective on the subject, this book brings together a team of highly respected sociologists, political scientists, economists, criminologists, and legal scholars to scrutinize the logic and evidence behind the widely held belief in a color-blind society&#x2014;and to provide an alternative explanation for continued racial inequality in the United States.<br><br>While not denying the economic advances of black Americans since the 1960s, <i>Whitewashing Race </i>draws on new and compelling research to demonstrate the persistence of racism and the effects of organized racial advantage across many institutions in American society&#x2014;including the labor market, the welfare state, the criminal justice system, and schools and universities. Looking beyond the stalled debate over current antidiscrimination policies, the authors also put forth a fresh vision for achieving genuine racial equality of opportunity in a post-affirmative action world.</p><p>"In <i>Whitewashing Race,</i> an impressive and diverse group of scholars launch an empirically grounded assault on the vast body of colorblind orthodoxy. The authors harness a medley of disciplinary perspectives into a cogent argument about racial stratification accompanied by a set of practical racial justice policy options. Their aim is both simple and ambitious: to reinvigorate a moribund debate by marshalling their collective intellectual resources to demonstrate that the conservative consensus on race is neither morally sustainable nor logically defensible."&#x2014;Lani Guinier, coauthor of <i>The Miner's Canary: Enlisting Race, Resisting Power, Transforming Democracy</i><br><br>"This powerful book disposes of the claim, so often heard, that America has solved its race problem and can now be 'color-blind.' Based on hard facts, it shows how we must work--for the sake of all of us--to give Black Americans the reality of equal opportunity."&#x2014;Anthony Lewis, author of <i>Gideon's Trumpet</i><br><br>"An essential book. Americans have always worked hard at burying our racial truths, thereby leaving half-truths, myths and raw bigotry to continue their brutal work on our most vulnerable citizens. The authors cauterize these terrible wounds with prodigious research and brilliant insights. Their work is a great service to justice and to our country."&#x2014;Roger Wilkins, author of <i>Jefferson's Pillow: The Founding Fathers and the Dilemma of Black Patriotism</i><br><br>"For many years conservative scholars and think tanks have been trying to convince the American public that racism is dead and that race-specific policies, such as affirmative action, cannot be justified and are in fact detrimental. To a great extent they have succeeded in making ostensible 'color-blindness' the dominant test of law and policy affecting racial minorities. Now at last we have the definitive response to this argument. It comes from seven distinguished scholars from a range of disciplines who believe that race must be taken into account if we are ever to get beyond racism. With massive evidence, much of it quantitative, they blast conservative color-blindness to smithereens, showing that it really functions as a formula to perpetuate racial inequality. No one concerned with racial justice in America can afford to ignore this book."&#x2014;George M. Fredrickson, author of <i>Racism: A Short History</i><br><br>"<i>Whitewashing Race</i> is the most important social science statement on race in more than a decade. It lays bare the expressly conservative, ideological, and deeply flawed analyses of those pundits pressing for 'color-blind' social policy. With lucid prose and truly definitive scholarship, Brown, Wellman, and colleagues thoroughly debunk the reigning conservative consensus. Anyone who cares about racial justice and the fate of the American Dream should read this vitally important book."&#x2014;Lawrence D. Bobo, editor of <i>Prismatic Metropolis: Inequality in Los Angeles</i><br><br>"Far from writing a collection of essays, the authors of <i>Whitewashing Race</i> have collaborated to produce a brilliant, seamless book on America's deepest divide. Framed as a response to conservative analysts who claim that racial problems are essentially solved, the book provides an authoritative overview of how the nation's two principal races still remain sharply apart by every social measure."&#x2014;Andrew Hacker, author of <i>Two Nations: Black and White, Separate, Hostile, Unequal</i><br><br>"In today's political climate, even the most well-meaning liberal tends to believe that institutional racism is a thing of the past and that we've truly achieved a color-blind society. <i>Whitewashing Race</i> makes a powerful case that racism is still with us. Relying on solid evidence rather than polemics, the authors have amassed an overwhelming body of data to show the persistence of racism in the job and housing market, education, the criminal justice system, and the political arena. If we ever have a real 'national conversation' on race, <i>Whitewashing Race</i> ought to be mandatory reading."&#x2014;Robin D. G. Kelley, author of <i>Freedom Dreams</i><b>Michael K.

Fisher Reader</h2><p>Gathering journals, letters, translations, and selections from her many books, The Measure of Her Powers showcases Fisher&#39;s versatility, providing new readers and loyal fans alike with a sampler from her wide-ranging body of work. M.F.K. Fisher is a perennial literary favorite. Her evolution from an uncertain young woman to a feisty elder with opinions about everything continues to fascinate readers who understand the complexities of life&#39;s hungers.</p><p>Perhaps it is the title, <i>The Measure of Her Powers</i>, that is the organizing principle behind this collection of writings lifted from the incredible oeuvre that M.F.K. Fisher left behind. A measurement, then, a means of finally understanding what all the noise may or may not be about. There are 27 books attributed to Fisher on the cover flap. Her writings pretty much cover a life lived full throttle from 1908 to 1992; <i>The Measure of Her Powers</i> pretty much covers her life as it has been written.<p> It's kind of like peering at a fascinating woman in different times in a long life through a ViewMaster, clicking right along: the girl at school, the young woman in France and Switzerland, the widow and mother in California, and so on. All of it is "seen" through a strong, gentle, steady voice. Clicking right along.</p><p> She was a better writer when exploring food and passion in her early works than she was later when reflecting. Exactly when any given piece was actually written is left off, though the original title from which any piece of text was drawn is included. The truly vigilant and curious could assemble the publishing dates and explore the times of this writer's life, comparing the one to the other.</p><p> <i>The Measure of Her Powers</i> is a grand excuse, really, to discover and to rediscover so unique an American writer as M.F.K. Fisher. For those who have never had the thrill of hearing that fluid voice of hers extolling the pleasures of a good meal and good company, it is here and waiting. For those who have forgotten that thrill, the reminder can be found between these covers. This is a text that points back to original volumes, where the writer may be more fully explored and appreciated. In some of those volumes the power of Fisher has no limits. In other volumes a certain tiresomeness and pointlessness creeps in. <i>The Measure of Her Powers</i> deftly maps the territory. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p>Mary Frances Kennedy Fisher is widely acknowledged as the creator of the genre we now call &#34;food writing.&#34; She was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters and received lifetime achievement awards from the James Beard Foundation and the American Institute of Wine and Food.</p><h2>Exploremos!

The existence of a coherent, pan-ethnic Latino political agenda is, as this book shows, not only highly debatable, but democratically unviable. <br><br>Situated at the intersection of political theory and Latino studies, <em>The Trouble with Unity</em> is a nuanced critique of civic Latinidad and the Latino electoral and protest politics that work to erase diversity and debate in favor of images of commonality. Cristina Beltr�n looks at key moments in U.S. Latino political history through the lens of political, feminist, and cultural thought to provide a theoretically driven account of the many ways in which Latinos lay claim to the public realm. In its innovative approach to the realities of Latino protest politics, <em>The Trouble with Unity</em> advances both social movement and democratic political theory.<br></p><p><br><strong>Cristina Beltr�n </strong>is Associate Professor of Social and Cultural Analysis at New York University.<br><br>"Cristina Beltr�n's powerful book, <em>The Trouble with Unity</em> is timely for our age of Obama in which an ugly anti-immigrant spirit looms large. Don't miss it!" --Cornel West, Princeton University <br><p></p><br>"In her lucid account of the complexities of identity politics, Cristina Beltr�n analyzes U.S. Latino efforts to forge a unified political community, persuasively arguing that unity-based politics can provide spaces for meaningful political action but too often minimizes major differences. <em>The</em> <em>Trouble with Unity</em> is an informative, balanced, and unusually thoughtful contribution." --Rogers M. Smith, Christopher H. Browne Distinguished Professor of Political Science, University of Pennsylvania <br><p></p><br>"Many have looked at the growth of Latino political identity from a purely empirical perspective. This work, however, tries to understand how Latino-ness is performed and understood in the public sphere, the growth and nature of pan-ethnic identity, and how disparate individuals come together to see themselves as a political interest. Cristina Beltr�n's book is a work of theory built off of a careful historical examination of practice and is a major contribution." --Gary Segura, Professor of Political Science and Chair of Chicana/o Studies, Stanford University <br><p></p><br>"This book makes an original and centrally important contribution by using categories of political theory to analyze the ways in which 'Latinos' have thought about their political identities. It will become essential reading for those interested in how political theorists can contribute to the rethinking of race and ethnicity." --Joan Tronto, Professor of Political Theory, University of Minnesota <br><p></p><br>"A sophisticated analysis of social justice in the Latino community.... useful for general readership and all undergraduate work on Latino studies in the US.... Recommended." --<em>CHOICE</em> <br><p></p><br>"The idea of applying political theory to movement politics is certainly unusual, but Beltr�n deftly weaves together empirical observation with normative insight in ways that allow us to see the dangers and promises of identity-based political movements." --<em>Perspectives on Politics</em> <br><p></p><br>"[P]ioneering... systematically dismantles outmoded political discourses in favor of emergent, negotiated, more complex coalitions of Latino solidarity." --<em>Contemporary Sociology</em> <br><p></p><br>"[A] dazzling reading of Latino politics... One of the signal achievements of The Trouble with Unity is its capacity to vivify the political value and limitations of theoretical canons, old and new. If Beltran's argument stimulates conversation across disciplinary boundaries and takes democratic theory to places where it has not typically wanted to go, she also offers a forceful reminder of why political theorists return to hallowed texts. <em>The Trouble with Unity</em> puts political theorists on notice: the construction of Latino identity [is] not [a] specialty subject. [It is] democratic theory."--<em>Political Theory</em> <br><p></p><br>"In this pioneering work of social theory, Cristina Beltr�n applies thought to the contemporary predicament of 'Latinos,' that portion of the U.S. population which is of Latin American origin or social identity." --<em>Contemporary Sociology</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>China Hands: Nine Decades of Adventure, Espionage, and Diplomacy in Asia</h2><p>James Lilley offers a personal look at his life in Asia, begining with his childhood in Tsingtao China, discussing his thirty years in the CIA in such places as Tokyo and Taiwan, before taking a job with the State Department as a diplomat.</p><p>During a government career spanning four decades, James Lilley served in the CIA, White House, State Department, and Defense Department. He is the only American to have served as the head of the American missions in Beijing, where he was ambassador from 1989-1991, and Taiwan, where he was Director of the American Institute in Taiwan from 1982-1984. He also served as the U.S. ambassador to South Korea from 1986-1989. He is currently a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, DC. <p> Jeffrey Lilley is a journalist. He lives in Silver Springs, Maryland, with his wife and two sons.</p><p> </p><p>James Lilley served on the operations side of the CIA, working on China, from 1951-74. He then switched to analysis and diplomacy, serving as U.S. representative in Taipei in 1982-84 and ambassador in Beijing in 1989-91, among other posts. One therefore combs his memoir for hints about how well U.S. intelligence understood China over those 40 years.</p><p>Until 1972, China was tightly closed. If there were significant intelligence triumphs, they remain confidential. But Lilley is frank about the frustrations. The agency's air-dropped agents disappeared, agency-supported Kuomintang military probes fizzled, the British authorities in Hong Kong forbade the Americans to try to penetrate Chinese offices there until 1968, and around the same time the CIA discovered that its main partner, Taiwan intelligence, was thoroughly compromised. Until Nixon opened China in 1972, the CIA seems to have known little more about the Chinese famine, the cultural revolution or Mao's interest in an opening to the United States than did any of the diligent graduate students who were, like them, sitting in Hong Kong interviewing refugees and decoding official propaganda.</p><p>Lilley went to Beijing in 1973 as the first CIA station chief, with Mao's consent (given to Kissinger). He could not do any real spying, but he biked around the city mapping safe houses, noted military installations and set up a secure communications channel inside the U.S. mission. He formed a close relationship with the second head of the office, George H.W. Bush, who years later appointed him to the China ambassadorship. Back in Washington, he played a key role in initiating intelligence-sharing with Beijing directed against the Soviet Union. Lilley hints at a later enhancement of this arrangement but does not explain it. </p><p>In Taiwan from 1982-84, Lilley met often with president Chiang Ching-kuo and other leaders in and out of government. He alludes to excellent U.S. intelligence on all aspects of politics on the island but doesn't say how it was obtained, other than through direct conversations.</p><p>Lilley's ambassadorship in China began just as the Tiananmen crisis was peaking. U.S. diplomats observed the demonstrators and troops from monitoring points and vehicles and by listening in, with permission, on ABC-TV's internal radio communications. Military attach� Larry Wortzel received a telephone tip-off to get people out of the diplomatic apartments before the People's Liberation Army raked the buildings with rifle fire. "Contacts" provided some insight into debates among the Chinese leadership. An informant in Hong Kong warned the CIA of a possible Chinese attempt to seize pro-democracy leader Fang Lizhi from his refuge in the U.S. embassy.</p><p>But there is more to China Hands than spying. Lilley was present at the creation of George H.W. Bush's special relationship with Deng Xiaoping in 1977. He offers new information on the internal U.S. government battle over the August 1982 communiqu� with China that was supposed to limit U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and also sheds light on a secret Ronald Reagan memo for the file that immediately rendered the communiqu� a dead letter. He also revisits Reagan's simultaneous "six assurances" to Taiwan that promised no pressure to negotiate with Beijing. He describes his role in preparing the way for controversial arms sales to Taiwan, particularly the Indigenous Defense Fighter and the F-16 aircraft. </p><p>And the book covers more than China. There is the secret war in Laos, which Lilley helped direct in 1965-68. Lilley's most stirring professional moment may have come during his 1986-88 ambassadorship to Korea, when he delivered a letter from President Reagan to Korean president Chun Doo Hwan that he believes helped avert a military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.</p><p>Young people considering diplomatic careers will notice that Lilley and his family moved almost every two years. The personal burden and that on wife and kids are quietly acknowledged. Was it worth it? Not only was good information hard to get, but Lilley also often felt that even when he had it his memos were not read, including when he was serving in Washington. He laments one cable in particular warning of an imminent crackdown on the student demonstrators in Beijing that went unseen by President Bush during Tiananmen. It seems that the bigger the issues one is dealing with, the harder it is to discern any individual influence on the outcome.</p><p>This memoir is also part of a lifelong effort to come to terms with the tragic early suicide of James's beloved elder brother, Frank -- an effort shared by James's son Jeffrey, a journalist who joined his father in writing the book. The moving early chapters describe the idyllic childhoods of James and his two handsome, athletic older brothers, when their father worked for Standard Oil in neo-colonial Tsingtao. In retrospect, the grown-up Lilley ponders how easily modern psychiatry might have treated Frank's depression and forestalled the damage his suicide wrought on everyone in the family.</p><p>The great lesson James drew from Frank's death was to "stay away from disillusionment." That preference for detachment and realism served James Lilley well in a career of unusual achievement that spanned four decades of American influence in Asia. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Reviewed by Andrew J.

Books and magazines have covered the cars, builders, pioneers, engineers, early racers, muscle cars, street racers, etc.. Most take a nostalgic and fun look at the cars that many have loved their entire lives. Some even cover the lifestyle, the hobby as it involves people, and the effort, time, and commitment people put into it. It is more than just a hobby to most, and to many, a certain wave of nostalgia comes over them when remembering what the car scene was like "back in the day."<p></p><p>The local speed shop is an important element of the nostalgic feeling that people have when fondly remembering their hot rodding youth. Speed shops were not just parts stores, they were a communal gathering place for car guys wanting to talk smart, bench race, and catch up on the local scene, as well as to solicit the expert advice from the owner or staff behind the counter. </p><p>Here, longtime hot rodder and industry veteran Bob McClurg brings you the story of the era and the culture of speed shops as told through individual shop's histories and compelling vintage photography. He covers the birth of the industry, racing versus hot rodding, mail-order, and advertising wars. You learn about the performance boom of the 1960s and 1970s, lost speed shops as well as survivors, and a overview of the giant mail-order speed shops of today.</p></p><p><p>Veteran automotive journalist Bob McClurg grew up in 1950s Southern California, where he was surrounded (and heavily influenced) by early hot rod culture.

In addition, Chris brings you the wish list of games he'd like to build and tells you how to do it. Game developers and designers will kill for this information! </p></p><p>When I wrote The Art of Computer Game Design way back in 1981, I really didn&#39;t know what I was doing; I wrote the book as a way to sort out my thoughts on game design. That effort helped me solidify my philosophy of game design -- and incidentally became a classic in the field. That book was a bunch of lucky guesses and inspired hunches. This book, by contrast, looks back on a career in game design spanning 25 years, and attempts to digest the lessons of that career. Back then, with so little experience to draw on, I was absolutely certain of my conclusions. This time around, I&#39;m not so sure -- but I&#39;ve got some humdinger stories to tell. Will this book be a classic 25 years from now? Maybe so, maybe not, but one thing I&#39;m sure of: 25 years from now, people will still be laughing over some of the crazy design misadventures I lived to tell about.<p> <b>Chris Crawford</b> is the "grand old man" of computing game design. He sold his first computer game in 1978, joined Atari in 1979, and led Games Research there. During his time at Atari, he wrote the first edition of <i>The Art of Computer Game Design</i> (Osborne, 1984), which has now become a classic in the field. After Atari collapsed in 1984, Chris became a freelance computer game designer. All in all, Chris has 14 published computer games to his credit&#x2014;all of which he designed and programmed himself. He founded, edited, and wrote most of <i>The Journal of Computer Game Design</i>, the first periodical devoted to game design. He founded and led the Computer Game Developers' Conference (now the Game Developers' Conference) in its early years. Chris has lectured on game design at conferences and universities all over the world. For the last ten years, he has been developing technology for interactive storytelling.</p></p><h2>Body Sweats: The Uncensored Writings of Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>The first major collection of poetry written in English by the flabbergasting and flamboyant Baroness Elsa, &#x201c;the first American Dada.&#x201d;</b></p><p>As a neurasthenic, kleptomaniac, man-chasing proto-punk poet and artist, the Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven left in her wake a ripple that is becoming a rip&#x2015;one hundred years after she exploded onto the New York art scene. As an agent provocateur within New York's modernist revolution, &#x201c;the first American Dada&#x201d; not only dressed and behaved with purposeful outrageousness, but she set an example that went well beyond the eccentric divas of the twenty-first century, including her conceptual descendant, Lady Gaga.</p><p>Her delirious verse flabbergasted New Yorkers as much as her flamboyant persona. As a poet, she was profane and playfully obscene, imagining a farting God, and transforming her contemporary Marcel Duchamp into M'ars (my arse). With its ragged edges and atonal rhythms, her poetry echoes the noise of the metropolis itself. Her love poetry muses graphically on ejaculation, orgasm, and oral sex. When she tired of existing words, she created new ones: &#x201c;phalluspistol,&#x201d; &#x201c;spinsterlollipop,&#x201d; &#x201c;kissambushed.&#x201d; The Baroness's rebellious, highly sexed howls prefigured the Beats; her intensity and psychological complexity anticipates the poetic utterances of Anne Sexton and Sylvia Plath.</p><p>Published more than a century after her arrival in New York, <i>Body Sweats</i> is the first major collection of Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven's poems in English. The Baroness's biographer Irene Gammel and coeditor Suzanne Zelazo have assembled 150 poems, most of them never before published. Many of the poems are themselves art objects, decorated in red and green ink, adorned with sketches and diagrams, presented with the same visceral immediacy they had when they were composed.</p></p><p>Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven (1874&#x2013;1927) was an artist and poet in Berlin, Munich, New York, and Paris.<p><i>Body Sweats</i> remaps the frontiers of modernism. It allows us to see, for the first time, just how radical Freytag-Loringhoven was: her linguistic fearlessness puts her in the same league as Mina Loy, Gertrude Stein, and Abraham Lincoln-Gillespie. These poems also offer a challenge to contemporary writers; a century on, her work is still as extreme as anything being published today.</p>&#x2015;<b>Craig Dworkin</b>, Professor of English, University of Utah<br><br><p>The Baroness's legendary but barely glimpsed 'omnipulsespun' oeuvre takes its place here as the most vital recovery of a neglected modernist since Mina Loy. Her panoramic 'arabesque grotesque' of sex poems, city poems, nature poems, sound poems, and an astonishingly rich visual portfolio is given an ingenious arrangement by the scrupulous editors, along with a poignant and sensible introduction. The Dada queen prankster comes to life at long last in all her 'stuttering incandescence.</p>&#x2015;<b>Jed Rasula</b>, Helen S.

An informative introduction for newcomers, a detailed set of notes on her poems for scholars, a generous presentation of her poetry, and, best of all, manuscript reproductions of her distinctively printed poems rescued from various archives&#x2015;what a marvelous gathering at last for the magnificent Baroness, who deserves no less from all her admirers.</p>&#x2015;<b>Dickran Tashjian</b>, Professor Emeritus of Art History, University of California, Irvine, author of <i>A Boatload of Madmen: Surrealism and the American Avant-Garde, 1920-1950</i></p><h2>Packard Motor Cars, 1935 Through 1942: Photo Archive- Photographs from the Detroit Public Library&#39;s National Automotive History Collection (Photo Archive Series)</h2><p>1935 marked Packard's move from a purely luxury car builder to a builder of luxury &amp; medium price cars, in a effort to broaden its market.

Not aimed at excising theological concerns from Dante, this approach instead attempts to break out of the hermeneutic guidelines that Dante structured into his poem and that have resulted in theologized readings whose outcomes have been overdetermined by the poet. By detheologizing, the reader can emerge from this poet's hall of mirrors and discover the narrative techniques that enabled Dante to forge a true fiction. Foregrounding the formal exigencies that Dante masked as ideology, Barolini moves from the problems of beginning to those of closure, focusing always on the narrative journey. Her investigation--which treats such topics as the visionary and the poet, the One and the many, narrative and time--reveals some of the transgressive paths trodden by a master of mimesis, some of the ways in which Dante's poetic adventuring is indeed, according to his own lights, Ulyssean.</p></p><p>The Undivine &#39;Comedy&#39; is a vigorous, perceptive contribution to our reading of Dante&#39;s work and to our understanding of the problems he confronted as a narrative poet.</p><h2>Revolutionary Politics and Locke&#39;s Two Treatises of Government</h2><p><p>Richard Ashcraft offers a new interpretation of the political thought of John Locke by viewing his ideas, especially those in the <i>Two Treatises of Government</i>, in the context of his political activity. Linking the implications of Locke's political theory with his practical politics, Professor Ashcraft focuses on Locke's involvement with the radical Whigs, who challenged the established order in England from the 1670s to the 1690s. An equally important aim of the author is to provide a case study of a revolutionary movement that includes a discussion of its organization, ideology, socio-economic composition, and political activities.</p><p> Based upon a detailed examination of manuscripts, diaries, correspondence, and newspapers, Professor Ashcraft presents a wealth of new historical evidence on the political life of Restoration England. This study represents an example of an approach to political theory that stresses the importance of authorial intentions and of the political, social, and economic influences that structure a particular political debate.</p></p><p><p>"This is one of the most significant contributions to Locke studies in the twentieth century. It is unparalleled in its reconstruction of the intellectual and practical context of Locke's political thought and in its meticulous interpretation of his texts in the light of the political struggles in which he was engaged. The reconstruction of Locke's role in the political struggles from 1670 to 1690, and of the struggles and debates themselves, will become the standard text in Locke studies. In addition, the book is a major practical contribution to the debate in the philosophy of the social sciences over the relation of knowledge and practice."--<b>James H.

The study of ancient, fossilized teeth sheds light on how our ancestors grew up, how we evolved, and how prehistoric cultural transitions continue to affect humans today.

Fossil teeth, highly resilient because of their substantial mineral content, are all that is left of some long-extinct species.

Counting tiny daily lines provides a way to estimate age that is more powerful than any other forensic technique. Dental plaque&#x2015;so carefully removed by dental hygienists today&#x2015;records our ancestors' behavior and health in the form of fossilized food particles and bacteria, including their DNA.

Dust jacket notes: "For the small fee of fifty cents, a moviegoer in the early 1900's could gain admittance to any 'Cathedral of Motion Picture' and enter the enchanted wonder of an Egyptian temple, Persian court, Italian Garden or Chinese palace. Going to the movies was a total experience. Once seated in the magnificent environment of the Roxy, Rialto, Egyptian or Metropolitan and surrounded by marble statuary and orate murals, the theatre would suddenly explode with music as a one hundred piece symphony orchestra arose from the floor and miraculously disappeared as matinee idols appeared on the screen. In 1928, the Roxy's enormous columns, arches, trellises and fountains humbled even the notables of government, industry, military and theatre who attended its opening. By 1940, the 'talkies' had become spectacles themselves, and the screen became the focus of attention rather than the surrounding theatre. Today these great buildings are a rare and vanishing species. Movie Palaces immortalizes these disappearing structures and recounts through photographs and text their fascinating origins, the great men who saw their dreams come true in the fabulous structures they built and the entrepreneurs and studios who found in the palaces an outlet for the gaudy and glamorous. Here are anecdotes about the stars, Gloria Swanson, Greata Garbo, Charlie Chaplin, whose fascinating lives contributed to the myths and gossip surrounding the palaces. This era, which marked the beginning of the motion picture industry, has almost completely vanished.

Her work reflects her Minnesota childhood, her Bohemian immigrant roots, and her self-image as a New Woman. Continually struggling with the financial and personal demands of her artistic career, Gag was, ironically, most famous for Millions of Cats (1928), one of her illustrated children's books.<br>Presenting the first catalogue raisonne of Gag's prints, Audur H. Winnan includes 196 lithographs, wood engravings, linoleum cuts, etchings, and study drawings. Among the featured prints are the well-known Lamplight, Elevated Station, Grandma's Kitchen, Grandma's Parlor, and Stone Crusher. Gag's media and methods are described, often in the artist's own words, including her unusual use of sandpaper as a matrix for lithographs and as a support for brush-and-ink drawings and watercolors. Also featuring many of her watercolors and drawings, the book traces each step of Gag's career and her role in the New York art world.<br>Winnan completes her portrait with selections from Gag's expressive diaries and letters. With extraordinary candor the artist describes her intimate personal thoughts and experiences and her friendships and encounters with many notable artists and other personalities, including Adolf Dehn, Lewis Gannett, Howard Cook, Rockwell Kent, John Marin, Georgia O'Keeffe, Diego Rivera, Alfred Stieglitz, John Taylor Arms, and Carl Zigrosser. Throughout her personal writings, Gag reflected on her career, the restrictions placed on women by society, and her sexual desires.

Set in the years leading up to the First World War, the work is an elegy, not just for an individual character, but for a generation lost in and affected by the war.This Shakespeare Head Press edition restores the text to its original form, notably recreating the space breaks on the page with which Woolf deliberately fragmented her narrative. The editor provides an extensive introduction, discussing the genesis of the novel, its biographical elements, the process of composition and revision, and the history of its early critical reception. A series of notes helps the reader to identify references and allusions, from sponge-bag trousers and gold beaters skin to Tonks and Steer, and the Hampstead Garden Suburbs; while an appendix lists variants between the first UK and first US editions of the work.<p>?<i>Jacob&#x2019;s Room</i> . . . comes as a tremendous surprise. The impossible has occurred . . . A new type of fiction has swum into view.&#x201d; --E. M. Forster</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This landmark novel tells the story of the all-too-brief life of Jacob Flanders, from his childhood in Scarborough through his student years at Cambridge and his bachelor days in London to his death while still a young man during World War I. Though he is an object of love and desire for many of the characters in the novel, Jacob remains curiously unknowable during his short life, as remote and mysterious as the classical landscapes and Greek ruins to which he is drawn. His room, the focus of so much longing and wondering over the course of the novel, is opened to those who care about him only after his death.&nbsp; This haunting elegy marks Woolf&#x2019;s assumption of her full powers as a Modernist novelist.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Virginia Woolf</b> (1882-1941), one of the major literary figures of the twentieth century, transformed the art of the novel.

Of all of Hemingway&#x2019;s canonical fictions, perhaps none demonstrate so forcefully the power of the author&#x2019;s revolutionary style as his short stories. In classics like &#x201c;Hills like White Elephants,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Butterfly in the Tank,&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber,&#x201d; Hemingway shows us great literature compressed to its most potent essentials. We also see, in Hemingway&#x2019;s short fiction, the tales that created the legend: these are stories of men and women in love and in war and on the hunt, stories of a lost generation born into a fractured time.<br> <br> <i>The Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway</i> presents many of Hemingway&#x2019;s most famous classics alongside rare and unpublished material: Hemingway&#x2019;s early drafts and correspondence, his dazzling out-of-print essay on the art of the short story, and two marvelous examples of his earliest work--his first published story, &#x201c;The Judgment of Manitou,&#x201d; which Hemingway wrote when still a high school student, and a never-before-published story, written when the author was recovering from a war injury in Milan after WWI. This work offers vital insight into the artistic development of one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s greatest writers. It is a perfect introduction for a new generation of Hemingway readers, and it belongs in the collection of any true Hemingway fan.</p><p>Ernest Hemingway did more to influence the style of English prose than any other writer of his time. Publication of&nbsp;<i>The Sun Also Rises</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>A Farewell to Arms</i>&nbsp;immediately established him as one of the greatest literary lights of the 20th century. His classic novella&nbsp;<i>The Old Man and the Sea&nbsp;</i>won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. He died in 1961.Cuentos Completos La breve vida feliz de Francis Macomber<p></p> <br>Era hora de comer y estaban sentados bajo la doble lona verde de la tienda comedor, fingiendo que no hab�a pasado nada. &#x2014;�Quer�is zumo de lima o limonada? &#x2014;pregunt� Macomber.<br> <br>&#x2014;Yo tomar� un gimlet &#x2014;le dijo Robert Wilson.<br> <br>&#x2014;Yo tambi�n tomar� un gimlet. Necesito tomar algo &#x2014;dijo la mujer de Macomber.<br> <br>&#x2014;Supongo que es lo mejor &#x2014;coincidi� Macomber&#x2014;. D�gale que prepare tres gimlets.<br> <br>El criado ya hab�a comenzado a prepararlos, sacando las botellas de las bolsas de lona isot�rmicas, empapadas de humedad en el viento que soplaba a trav�s de los �rboles que sombreaban las tiendas.<br> <br>&#x2014;�Qu� deber�a darles? &#x2014;pregunt� Macomber.<br> <br>&#x2014;Una libra ser�a m�s que suficiente &#x2014;le dijo Wilson&#x2014;. No querr� malcriarlos.<br> <br>&#x2014;�El capataz lo repartir�?<br> <br>&#x2014;Desde luego.<br> <br>Media hora antes Francis Macomber hab�a sido triunfalmente transportado hasta su tienda, desde los l�mites del campamento, a hombros y brazos del cocinero, los criados, el despellejador y los porteadores. Los porteadores de armas no hab�an tomado parte en el desfile. Cuando los muchachos nativos lo depositaron en el suelo a la puerta de su tienda, Macomber les estrech� a todos la mano, recibi� sus felicitaciones y luego entr� y se sent� en la cama hasta que lleg� su mujer. Cuando ella entr� no le dijo nada, �l sali� de la tienda enseguida para lavarse la cara y las manos en la jofaina port�til que hab�a fuera y dirigirse luego a la tienda comedor, donde se sent� en una c�moda silla de lona a la brisa y a la sombra.<br> <br>&#x2014;Ya ha conseguido su le�n &#x2014;le dijo Robert Wilson&#x2014;, y un le�n condenadamente bueno.<br> <br>La se�ora Macomber se volvi� rauda hacia Wilson. Era una mujer extremadamente guapa y bien conservada, pose�a la belleza y posici�n social que cinco a�os atr�s le hab�an permitido exigir cinco mil d�lares para promocionar, con fotograf�as, un producto de belleza que nunca hab�a utilizado. Llevaba once a�os casada con Francis Macomber.<br> <br>&#x2014;Era un buen le�n, �verdad? &#x2014;dijo Francis Macomber. Ahora su esposa le miraba. Miraba a los dos hombres como si nunca los hubiera visto.<br> <br>A uno, Wilson, el cazador profesional, sab�a que no lo hab�a visto antes de emprender el safari. Era de estatura mediana y pelo pajizo, bigotillo de pelos cortos y tiesos, la cara muy roja y unos ojos extremadamente azules con unas arruguillas blancas en las comisuras que se hac�an m�s profundas cuando sonre�a. Ahora �l le sonre�a, y ella apart� la mirada de su cara y la dirigi� a la ca�da de sus hombros bajo la chaqueta holgada que llevaba, con cuatro grandes cartuchos en las presillas donde deber�a haber habido el bolsillo izquierdo, a sus manos grandes y morenas, a sus pantalones viejos, sus botas muy sucias, y luego volvi� a su cara roja. Se fij� en que el rojo recocido de su cara quedaba delimitado por una l�nea blanca que se�alaba la frontera de su sombrero Stetson, que ahora colgaba de uno de los colgadores del palo de la tienda.<br> <br>&#x2014;Bueno, por el le�n &#x2014;dijo Robert Wilson. Volvi� a sonre�r a la se�ora Macomber, y esta, sin sonre�r, mir� con curiosidad a su marido.<br> <br>Francis Macomber era muy alto, muy bien formado si no te importaba que tuviera los huesos tan largos, atezado, con el pelo rapado como un galeote, labios bastante finos, y se le consideraba un hombre apuesto. Llevaba la misma clase de ropas de safari que Wilson, solo que las suyas eran nuevas. Ten�a treinta y cinco a�os, se manten�a muy en forma, era buen deportista, pose�a varios r�cords de pesca mayor, y acababa de demostrarse a s� mismo, a la vista de todo el mundo, que era un cobarde.<br> <br>&#x2014;Por el le�n &#x2014;dijo&#x2014;. Nunca podr� agradecerle lo que hizo.<br> <br>Margaret, su esposa, apart� la mirada de �l y la dirigi� a Wilson.<br> <br>&#x2014;No hablemos del le�n &#x2014;dijo ella.<br> <br>Wilson le dirigi� una mirada sin sonre�r y ahora fue ella quien le sonri�.<br> <br>&#x2014;Ha sido un d�a muy raro &#x2014;dijo&#x2014;. �No deber�a llevar el sombrero puesto aunque estemos debajo de una lona? Me lo dijo usted, por si no lo recuerda.<br> <br>&#x2014;Puede que me lo ponga &#x2014;dijo Wilson.<br> <br>&#x2014;Sabe que tiene la cara muy roja, se�or Wilson &#x2014;le dijo ella, y volvi� a sonre�r.<br> <br>&#x2014;La bebida &#x2014;dijo Wilson.<br> <br>&#x2014;No lo creo &#x2014;dijo ella&#x2014;. Francis bebe mucho, pero la cara nunca se le pone roja.<br> <br>&#x2014;Hoy est� roja &#x2014;dijo Macomber intentando hacer un chiste.<br> <br>&#x2014;No &#x2014;dijo Margaret&#x2014;. La m�a es la que est� hoy roja. Pero la del se�or Wilson lo est� siempre.<br> <br>&#x2014;Debe de ser una cuesti�n racial &#x2014;dijo Wilson&#x2014;. Y digo yo, �qu� les parece si dejamos de hablar de mi belleza?<br> <br>&#x2014;Pero si acabo de empezar.<br> <br>&#x2014;Pues vamos a dejarlo &#x2014;dijo Wilson.<br> <br>&#x2014;La conversaci�n va a ser dif�cil &#x2014;dijo Margaret.<br> <br>&#x2014;No seas tonta, Margot &#x2014;dijo su marido.<br> <br>&#x2014;De dif�cil nada &#x2014;dijo Wilson&#x2014;. Ha conseguido un le�n magn�fico.<br> <br>Margot los mir� a los dos, y ambos se dieron cuenta de que estaba a punto de llorar. Wilson hac�a ya rato que se lo ve�a venir, y le aterraba. Pero Macomber ya hab�a superado ese terror.<br> <br>&#x2014;Ojal� no hubiera ocurrido. Oh, ojal� no hubiera ocurrido &#x2014;dijo ella, y se dirigi� a su tienda. No emiti� ning�n sonido, pero los dos vieron que le temblaban los hombros bajo la camisa de color rosa, resistente al sol.<br> <br>&#x2014;Las mujeres se disgustan &#x2014;le dijo Wilson al hombre alto&#x2014;. En realidad no ha sido nada. Los nervios demasiado tensos, y una cosa y otra...<br> <br>&#x2014;No &#x2014;dijo Macomber&#x2014;. Supongo que ahora llevar� esa cruz el resto de mi vida.<br> <br>&#x2014;Tonter�as. Tomemos una copa de este matagigantes &#x2014;dijo Wilson&#x2014;. Olv�delo todo. No ha sido nada.<br> <br>&#x2014;Lo intentaremos &#x2014;dijo Macomber&#x2014;. De todos modos, nunca olvidar� lo que hizo por m�.<br> <br>&#x2014;Nada &#x2014;dijo Wilson&#x2014;. Tonter�as.<br> <br>De modo que se quedaron sentados a la sombra. Hab�an instalado el campamento bajo unas acacias de ancha copa, y detr�s de ellos hab�a un precipicio salpicado de rocas, delante una extensi�n de hierba que iba hasta la orilla de un arroyo lleno de rocas, y m�s all� un bosque. Tomaron sus bebidas de lima, enfriadas al punto, y evitaron mirarse a los ojos mientras los criados preparaban la mesa para comer. Wilson se dio cuenta de que todos los criados ya estaban al corriente, y cuando vio al criado personal de Macomber mirando a su amo lleno de curiosidad mientras pon�a los platos en la mesa le espet� unas palabras en swahili. El chico apart� la mirada. Estaba p�lido.<br> <br>&#x2014;�Qu� le estaba diciendo? &#x2014;pregunt� Macomber.<br> <br>&#x2014;Nada. Le he dicho que se espabilara o me encargar�a de que le dieran quince de los buenos.<br> <br>&#x2014;�Quince qu�? �Azotes?<br> <br>&#x2014;Es ilegal &#x2014;dijo Wilson&#x2014;. Se supone que debemos multarlos.<br> <br>&#x2014;�Y usted a�n los azota?<br> <br>&#x2014;Oh, s�. Si decidieran quejarse armar�an un foll�n de mil demonios. Pero no se quejan. Lo prefieran a las multas.<br> <br>&#x2014;�Qu� raro! &#x2014;dijo Macomber.<br> <br>&#x2014;No, la verdad es que no es raro &#x2014;dijo Wilson&#x2014;. Usted, �qu� preferir�a, perder el sueldo o que le dieran unos buenos azotes?<br> <br>Pero enseguida se avergonz� de haberle hecho aquella pregunta, y antes de que Macomber pudiera contestar a�adi�:<br> <br>&#x2014;A todos nos dan una paliza todos los d�as, sabe, de uno u otro modo.<br> <br>Eso tampoco lo arregl�. Dios m�o, se dijo. Qu� diplom�tico soy.<br> <br>&#x2014;S�, a todos nos dan una paliza &#x2014;dijo Macomber, todav�a sin mirarle&#x2014;. Siento much�simo lo del le�n. No tiene por qu� salir de aqu�, �verdad? Quiero decir que nadie tiene por qu� enterarse, �no cree?<br> <br>&#x2014;�Quiere decir si lo contar� en el Mathaiga Club? &#x2014;Ahora Wilson lo miraba fr�amente. No se esperaba eso. As� que adem�s de un maldito cobarde es un maldito cabr�n, se dijo. Me ca�a bastante bien hasta hoy. Pero con los americanos nunca se sabe.<br> <br>&#x2014;No &#x2014;dijo Wilson&#x2014;. Soy un cazador profesional. Nunca hablamos de nuestros clientes. Puede estar tranquilo por lo que a eso respecta. Adem�s, se supone que es de mal tono pedirnos que no hablemos.<br> <br>Acababa de decidir que lo m�s f�cil ser�a romper cualquier asomo de amistad. Comer�a solo, y durante las comidas podr�a leer. Todos comer�an solos. Durante el safari mantendr�a con ellos esa relaci�n m�s formal &#x2014;�c�mo lo llamaban los franceses?, distinguida consideraci�n&#x2014; y ser�a much�simo m�s f�cil que tener que pasar por toda esa basura emocional. Le insultar�a y romper�an limpiamente su amistad. Luego podr�a leer alg�n libro a la hora de comer y seguir�a bebi�ndose el whisky de los Macomber. Esa era la frase adecuada para cuando un safari iba mal. Te topabas con otro cazador y le preguntabas: ��C�mo va todo?�, y �l te contestaba: �Oh, todav�a sigo bebi�ndome su whisky�, y sab�as que todo se hab�a ido al garete.<br> <br>&#x2014;Lo siento &#x2014;dijo Macomber, y lo mir� con esa cara de americano que seguir�a siendo adolescente hasta que alcanzara la mediana edad, y Wilson observ� su pelo cortado a cepillo, su mirada apenas furtiva, la hermosa nariz, sus finos labios y la apuesta barbilla&#x2014;. Siento mucho no haberme dado cuenta. Hay muchas cosas que ignoro.<br> <br>Qu� pod�a hacer, pues, se dijo Wilson. Estaba a punto de acabar con aquella relaci�n de una manera r�pida y limpia, y el miserable se pon�a a disculparse despu�s de haberlo insultado.<br> <br>&#x2014;No se preocupe por lo que yo pueda decir &#x2014;replic� Wilson&#x2014;. Tengo que ganarme la vida. Ya sabe que en �frica ninguna mujer falla cuando dispara a su le�n y ning�n hombre blanco sale nunca por piernas.<br> <br>&#x2014;Pues yo sal� corriendo como un conejo &#x2014;dijo Macomber.<br> <br>Bueno, qu� demonios hab�a que hacer con un hombre que hablaba as�, se pregunt� Wilson.<br> <br>Wilson mir� a Macomber con sus ojos azules y apagados de quien sabe manejar una ametralladora y el otro le devolvi� la sonrisa. Ten�a una agradable sonrisa si no te fijabas en c�mo lo delataban los ojos cuando estaba ofendido.<br> <br>&#x2014;A lo mejor puedo arreglarlo cuando cacemos b�falos &#x2014;dijo Macomber&#x2014;. Cazaremos b�falos, �verdad?<br> <br>&#x2014;Por la ma�ana, si quiere &#x2014;le dijo Wilson. Tal vez se hab�a equivocado. Desde luego, as� era como hab�a que tom�rselo. Desde luego, no se sab�a nunca con estos americanos. Ahora ya volv�a a estar del lado de Macomber. Si consegu�a olvidarse de esa ma�ana. Pero claro, no pod�a. Aquella hab�a sido una mala ma�ana con ganas.<br> <br>&#x2014;Aqu� viene la memsahib &#x2014;dijo. Volv�a de su tienda, parec�a haberse refrescado y se la ve�a alegre y encantadora. Su cara era un �valo perfecto, tan perfecto que esperabas que fuera est�pida. Pero no lo era, se dijo Wilson, no, no era est�pida.<br> <br>&#x2014;�C�mo est� el guapo se�or Wilson de cara roja? �Te encuentras mejor, Francis, tesoro?<br> <br>&#x2014;Oh, mucho mejor &#x2014;dijo Francis.<br> <br>&#x2014;Ya no quiero pensar m�s en eso &#x2014;dijo Margaret, sent�ndose a la mesa&#x2014;. �Qu� m�s da que Francis sea bueno o no matando leones? No es su oficio. Es el oficio del se�or Wilson. El se�or Wilson impresiona bastante matando cualquier cosa. Usted mata cualquier cosa, �verdad?<br> <br>&#x2014;Oh, lo que sea &#x2014;dijo Wilson&#x2014;. Sencillamente, lo que sea. &#x2014;Son las m�s duras del mundo; las m�s duras, las m�s crueles, las m�s depredadoras y las m�s atractivas, y sus hombres se han ablandado o se han quedado con los nervios destrozados mientras ellas se endurec�an. �O es que solo escogen a los hombres que pueden manejar? Aunque a la edad en que se casan eso no pueden saberlo, se dijo Wilson. Dio gracias por haber aprobado ya la asignatura de las mujeres americanas, porque aquella era muy atractiva.<br> <br>&#x2014;Iremos a cazar b�falos por la ma�ana &#x2014;le dijo a Margaret.<br> <br>&#x2014;Yo ir� &#x2014;dijo ella.<br> <br>&#x2014;No, no ir�.<br> <br>&#x2014;Oh, s�, ir�. �Puedo, Francis?<br> <br>&#x2014;�Por qu� no te quedas en el campamento?<br> <br>&#x2014;Por nada del mundo &#x2014;dijo ella&#x2014;. No me perder�a algo como lo de hoy por nada del mundo.<br> <br>Cuando Margaret se fue a llorar, estaba pensando Wilson, parec�a una mujer estupenda de verdad. Parec�a comprender, darse cuenta de las cosas, que se apenaba por �l y por ella y que sab�a cu�l era realmente la situaci�n. Est� fuera veinte minutos y ahora vuelve recubierta de esa crueldad femenina americana. No hay quien pueda con ellas. Desde luego, no hay quien pueda con ellas.<br> <br>&#x2014;Ma�ana montaremos otro numerito para ti &#x2014;dijo Francis Macomber.<br> <br>&#x2014;Usted no viene &#x2014;dijo Wilson.<br> <br>&#x2014;Est� usted muy equivocado &#x2014;le contest� ella&#x2014;. Y tengo much�simas ganas de verle actuar de nuevo. Esta ma�ana ha estado fabuloso, si es que es fabuloso volarle la cabeza a un animal.<br> <br>&#x2014;Aqu� est� la comida &#x2014;dijo Wilson&#x2014;. Est� contenta, �verdad?<br> <br>&#x2014;�Por qu� no? No he venido aqu� a bostezar.<br> <br>&#x2014;Bueno, no ha sido aburrido &#x2014;dijo Wilson.

But when this angers her neighbors, will she have to fight for her students&#39; education?</p><p>Professor, College of Education Temple University Dr. Michael Smith joined the ranks of college teachers after eleven years of teaching high school English. He has won awards for his teaching at both the high school and college levels. His research focuses on how experienced readers read and talk about texts, as well as what motivates adolescents' reading and writing both in and out of school. He has written eight books and monographs, including "Reading Don't Fix No Chevys": Literacy in the Lives of Young Men, for which he and his co-author received the 2003 David H.

His writing has appeared in such journals as Communication Education, English Journal, Journal of Adolescent &amp; Adult Literacy, Journal of Educational Research, Journal of Literacy Research, and Research in the Teaching of English.*Starred Review* Gr. 5-8. Jurmain has plucked an almost forgotten incident from history and has shaped a compelling, highly readable book around it. In 1831, Prudence Crandall opened a school for young white ladies. When asked by an African American teenager if she might join the class, Crandall, whose sympathies were with the abolitionists, agreed. So begins a jolting episode in which Crandall turned her school into one for girls of color, and is both tormented and sued by the citizenry of Canterbury, Connecticut, who wanted no part of African Americans in their town. Writing with a sense of drama that propels readers forward (and quoting the language of the day, which includes the word <i>nigger</i>), Jurmain makes painfully clear what Crandall and her students faced, while showing their courage as they stood up to those who tried to deter them. Printed on thick, snowy stock and including a number of sepia-toned and color photographs as well as historical engravings, the book's look will draw in readers. Children will be especially pleased by the appended material, which includes an epilogue that tells what became of the principals, as well as source notes for the many quotes. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Peter Constantine's historic collection presents 38 new stories and with them a fresh interpretation of the Russian master. In contrast to the brooding representative of a dying century we have seen over and over, here is Chekhov's work from the 1880s, when Chekhov was in his twenties and his writing was sharp, witty and innovative. <br>Many of the stories in The Undiscovered Chekhov reveal Chekhov as a keen modernist. Emphasizing impressions and the juxtaposition of incongruent elements, instead of the straight narrative his readers were used to, these stories upturned many of the assumptions of storytelling of the period. <br>Here is "Sarah Bernhardt Comes to Town," written as a series of telegrams, beginning with "Have been drinking to Sarah's health all week! Enchanting! She actually dies standing up!..." In "Confession...," a thirty-nine year old bachelor recounts some of the fifteen times chance foiled his marriage plans. In "How I Came to be Lawfully Wed," a couple reminisces about the day they vowed to resist their parents' plans that they should marry. And in the more familiarly Chekhovian "Autumn," an alcoholic landowner fallen low and a peasant from his village meet far from home in a sad and haunting reunion in which the action of the story is far less important than the powerful impression it leaves with the reader that each man must live his life and has his reasons.</p><p>Here's a treat for any Chekhov lover: a collection of 38 previously untranslated stories by the Russian master. Even better, these stories date back to the 1880s, when the author was still in his 20s and at his most prolific. That he wrote at all is something of a miracle--unlike other great Russian authors of his time (Dostoevski, Pushkin, Tolstoy, to name a few), Anton Chekhov was not a member of the nobility. The son of a bankrupt grocer, he entered medical school and became, at the same time, the breadwinner for his impoverished family by cranking out stories for magazines. His revolutionary approach to literature was apparent from the get-go. In "Sarah Bernhardt Comes to Town," for example, Chekhov uses a string of telegrams instead of a conventional narrative to tell his story. ("Telegram: Have been drinking to Sarah's health all week! Enchanting! She actually dies standing up! Our actors can't touch the Parisians!") Even more unusual for 19th-century literature is the apparent lack of a plot. The telegrams are simply a collection of reactions to a single performance, from an usher ("Let in four. Fourteen rubles. Let in five. Fifteen r. Let in three and one madame. Fifteen rubles") to a doctor ("Last night I saw S.B. Her chest--paralytic and flat. Skeletal and muscular structure--unsatisfactory") to various members of the audience ("Darling! When it comes to Sarah Bernhardt, as the saying goes: you can dip a frog in honey but it doesn't mean I'll eat it"). <p> All the qualities the more mature Chekhov is known for in his later works are apparent in these early stories: unconventional narratives, tremendous wit, psychological perspicacity, and above all that peculiarly modern interest in <i>why</i> human beings behave the way they do. Translator Peter Constantine's introduction gives readers both a good overview of Chekhov's life and a literary context for appreciating the stories collected here, but it is Chekhov himself whose remarkable brilliance will keep readers coming back for more. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><b>ANTON CHEKHOV</b> (1860&#x2013;1904) is regarded as one of the world&#x2019;s masters of the short story. The son of a hapless shopkeeper and grandson of a former serf, Chekhov began at the age of twenty to support his family through the publication of magazine pieces. The writing of these short works&#x2014;many of which were collected in English for the first time in Seven Stories&#x2019; <i>Undiscovered Chekhov</i>&#x2014;served as the author&#x2019;s apprenticeship in literature, which was undertaken simultaneously with his studies to become a medical doctor. Both of these educations would leave their mark on the rising author. By the 1890s Chekhov had moved on to weightier journals, and he had drifted away from the practice of medicine; but his work would always be characterized by the copywriter&#x2019;s vividness and the sober exactitude of a scientist. In an age of literary aristocrats, Chekhov did as much as any modern writer to democratize the profession. He used his talent to examine the lives of street urchins, d�class� provincials, and frustrated reformers. By the time of his death from tuberculosis in 1904, all Russia and much of the world had taken heed of his credo: &#x201c;For chemists there is nothing unclean on the earth. The writer must be as objective as the chemist.&#x201d;<br><br>Translator <b>PETER CONSTANTINE</b> is the author of many books on the languages and cultures of the Far East.

This quiet street in Buford is a relatively new part of an upscale neighborhood, home to young and middle-aged professionals and their families. The houses here have mostly red-brick fa�ades with glossy black shutters, not unlike homes in Atlanta's more affluent districts, but on a smaller scale. In 2004, the average price of a home in Bogan Gates was between $200,000 and $300,000 -- the homes would cost twice that in Denver or Seattle or Philadelphia. Buford is an ideal suburb for those who commute the thirty-five miles to Atlanta: large enough with over 14,000 residents to merit local shopping centers, but small enough to dissolve the tension that comes with driving the I-285 beltway that encircles Atlanta with bumper-to-bumper traffic. And Bogan Gates Drive itself is an oasis of serenity with its manicured lawns and colorful gardens. Children play under the watchful eyes of all the adults there. If some stranger should insinuate himself into this enclave, he would not go unnoticed.</p><p>A negative note, at least for some, is that close neighbors tend to know each other's secrets. There isn't the anonymity that exists in apartment buildings in large cities. Neither is there the loneliness that city dwellers sometimes feel. Even so, some families on the street have secrets that none of their neighbors could possibly imagine.</p><p>That doesn't stamp Bogan Gates as different; every community has its mysteries and even its surprising secrets. When reporters for television news and local papers sweep into such places, they are certain to obtain instant interviews with shocked residents who invariably say: "Something like that just doesn't happen here -- not in our neighborhood!"</p><p>But, of course, it does.</p><p>On this day in early December, Bogan Gates Drive just happened to be the site of one of the most horrific crimes in Georgia.</p><p>The town of Buford, its name as Southern as a name can be, sits close to Lake Lanier. This popular vacation spot's waters meander for mile after mile, cutting channels deep and wide into the shoreline, leaving inlets that resemble the bite marks of a giant alligator. Buford is surrounded by other small townships: Flowery Branch, Sugar Hill, Suwanee, Duluth, Oakville, Alpharetta. It is very close to the border between Gwinnett and Forsyth counties. Forsyth County once had a reputation as one of the most racially prejudiced areas in America. A sign beside the road there could read "Boiled Peanuts," or it might say, "Nigger, Get Out of Forsyth County, Before Sunset." But no longer. Oprah Winfrey once broadcast her show from Forsyth County, pulling aside the blinds to reveal raw prejudice. Today, those with set ideas about racial disparities have learned not to voice them aloud.</p><p>Buford, in Gwinnett County, is far more in tune with the twenty-first century, a bedroom community tied to a thriving metropolis. Young families who live there can enjoy relatively small-town warmth, or drive to Atlanta for more cosmopolitan pleasures.</p><p>The family who lived at 4515 Bogan Gates Drive fit comfortably into Buford's demographics. Dr. Barton T. Corbin, forty, had recently moved his dental practice to Hamilton Mill -- less than ten miles away. His wife, Jennifer "Jenn" Corbin, taught at a preschool in the Sugar Hill Methodist Church. Although Dr. Corbin's efforts to build a new practice often kept him away from home, and Jenn was the parent who spent more time with their children, they both seemed to dote on their sons, Dalton, seven, and Dillon, five. They went to the boys' ballgames and participated in school events at Harmony Elementary School, where Dalton was in second grade and Dillon in kindergarten.</p><p>Married almost nine years, the Corbins appeared to have all those things that most young couples long for: healthy children, a lovely home, admired professions, close family ties, and myriad friends.</p><p>Jenn Corbin, thirty-three, was tall and pretty, a big-boned blond who usually had a smile on her face, no matter what worries might lie behind it. Bart was also tall, taller than Jenn by two or three inches, but beyond that he was her opposite. His hair was almost black, his eyes even darker, his pale skin surprisingly dotted with freckles. He was a "gym rat" whose muscular physique showed the results of his predawn workouts. When Bart was dealing with a problem, however, or worrying over his finances, he lost weight rapidly and became angular and bony. Then his cheekbones protruded and his profile turned sharp as an ax, almost Lincolnesque.</p><p>Many of his female patients found Bart strikingly handsome; some others were a little put off by his intensity. But most of Bart Corbin's patients seemed to like him. He often traded dental care with his personal friends for some service he needed, using an old-fashioned barter system.</p><p>To an outsider, the Corbins' marriage appeared solid -- her sunniness balancing his sometimes dark moods. In truth, tiny threadlike fissures had crept silently through the perceived foundation of their marriage, weakening its structure from the inside out until a single blow could send it crumbling.</p><p>Most people who knew the Corbins weren't aware that Jenn had fled their home shortly after Thanksgiving of 2004, and that a divorce might be forthcoming. Those who did know were shaken that "Bart" and "Jenn" might be splitting up. To the world, they were a team, their very names strung together like one word when their friends talked about them. Bart-n-Jenn.</p><p>Jenn Corbin was responsible for that. She had struggled to maintain the fa�ade that kept the foundering state of her marriage virtually invisible to the outside world. For at least eight years she continued to hope that she and Bart could somehow work out their problems and build a happy relationship. If they did accomplish that, there was no reason for anyone to know. If their union was irretrievably broken, people would know soon enough.</p><p>And know they would because, by the fall of 2004, Jenn had given up. Her parents, Narda and Max Barber, and her sisters, Heather and Rajel, knew that, although even they were reluctant to accept it. Jenn had tried to understand her husband and to make allowances for behavior she didn't understand. She had forgiven Bart for betrayals most other women would not put up with. It was he who had laid down the ground rules in their marriage, and she had accepted them. She hadn't gotten married with the idea that if it didn't work out, they could always get divorced. She and her sisters were born to parents who had married only once -- and who had just happily celebrated their fortieth anniversary.</p><p>Jenn Corbin was one of those people whom almost everybody liked, probably because she liked everybody. She thought of others before she took care of herself and she protected her small sons like a lioness would, doing everything she could to be sure they were serene and happy. She was the same way with the youngsters she taught in preschool at the church. She had a warm lap and sheltering arms when their tears came.</p><p>Jenn was a Barber before she became a Corbin, raised in a loving and a very close family. When she and Bart married, her family had opened up the circle and welcomed him in. Except for his occasional flashes of temper, Bart was a lot of fun and he happily participated in holi-day celebrations, outings on the Corbins' and Barbers' adjoining houseboats, or on picnics and trips. They all shared the kind of extended family loyalty that isn't seen very often.</p><p>Although Bart's mother, Connie, and his brothers -- Brad, Bart's twin, and Bobby -- didn't spend much time with the Barbers, their connection was amiable enough, if a bit distant. Bart's father, Gene Corbin, had remarried and wasn't often in touch.</p><p>The Corbins' marital difficulties didn't stem from in-law problems. Rather, Bart's new dental clinic was struggling, and a renewal of old issues had left their marriage on the precarious edge of oblivion. But with Christmas only three weeks away, Jenn was looking forward to finishing the decorations on a tall tree that sat in the Corbins' formal dining room. Her little boys shouldn't have to miss out on Santa Claus because of an adult situation that wasn't their fault. She was halfway through with the tree, and she had stacked boxes nearby that held her treasured sentimental ornaments, new ones she had purchased during the year, and, most precious, Dalton's and Dillon's handmade art work they were so proud of. Jenn already had wrapped and hidden lots of presents for the boys.</p><p></p><p>It was 7:30 on this Saturday morning, December 4, 2004, when Steve and Kelly Comeau, who lived across the street from the Corbins' house, were startled to hear someone knocking at their front door. They were still in bed; Steve had been out late helping a friend hang pictures, and on the way home he had stopped to help a stranded driver change a flat tire. When he answered the door, he looked down to see Dalton Corbin, age seven. Dalton's face was red and his cheeks were streaked with tears. He wore pajamas and appeared to be very upset.</p><p>"My mom isn't breathing," Dalton said. "My daddy shot my Mommy -- I need you to call 911."</p><p>Skeptical, Steve Comeau nevertheless called 911, while Kelly followed Dalton across the street to check on Jenn Corbin. She didn't even think about danger to herself, because she doubted that Dalton could really have seen what he said he had. Jenn was most likely just sleeping heavily.</p><p>The Corbins' overhead garage door was open. Kelly hurried beneath it, found that the door to the kitchen was unlocked, and headed down the hall toward the master bedroom, calling out Jenn's name. There was no answer.</p><p>There was light in the bedroom, although Kelly couldn't remember later if it was daylight or from a lamp. She could see Jenn lying diagonally across the bed. It was an odd position, and Kelly felt a little shiver of alarm. She told herself that Jenn was only sleeping, and she reached out to ...</p></p><h2>Wind and Solar Power Systems</h2><p>Wind and solar energy are pollution-free sources of abundant power.

It also introduces and relates the most commonly used semiconductor terms and concepts to a broad range of devices. In addition, the work presents the study of solid state devices including both silicon and compound semiconductors so that undergraduate students may appreciate the continuing growth in importance of exciting optoelectronic and high-speed device applications.</p><p>This revision of the most widely used introduction to solid state electronic devices was developed with two basic purposes: 1) to provide students with a sound understanding of existing devices so their studies of electronic circuits and systems will be meaningful, and 2) to develop the basic tools with which they can later learn about applications and the latest devices.Preface <p> This book is an introduction to semiconductor devices for undergraduate electrical engineers, other interested students, and practicing engineers and scientists whose understanding of modern electronics needs updating. The book is organized to bring students with a background in sophomore physics to a level of understanding which will allow them to read much of the current literature on new devices and applications. Goals </p><p> An undergraduate course in electronic devices has two basic purposes: (1) to provide students with a sound understanding of existing devices, so that their studies of electronic circuits and systems will be meaningful; and (2) to develop the basic tools with which they can later learn about newly developed devices and applications. Perhaps the second of these objectives is the more important in the long run; it is clear that engineers and scientists who deal with electronics will continually be called upon to learn about new devices and processes in the future. For this reason, we have tried to incorporate the basics of semiconductor materials and conduction processes in solids, which arise repeatedly in the literature when new devices are explained. Some of these concepts are often omitted in introductory courses, with the view that they are unnecessary for understanding the fundamentals of junctions and transistors. We believe this view neglects the important goal of equipping students for the task of understanding a new device by reading the current literature. Therefore, in this text most of the commonly used semiconductor terms and concepts are introduced and related to a broad range of devices. Reading Lists </p><p> As a further aid in developing techniques for independent study, the reading list at the end of each chapter includes a few articles which students can read comfortably as they study this book. Some of these articles have been selected from periodicals such as Scientific American and Physics Today, which specialize in introductory presentations. Other articles chosen from books and the professional literature provide a more quantitative treatment of the material. We do not expect that students will read all articles recommended in the reading lists; nevertheless, some exposure to periodicals is useful in laying the foundation for a career of constant updating and self-education. Problems </p><p> One of the keys to success in understanding this material is to work problems that exercise the concepts. The problems at the end of each chapter are designed to facilitate learning the material. Very few are simple "plug-in" problems. Instead, they are chosen to reinforce or extend the material presented in the chapter. Units </p><p> In keeping with the goals described above, examples and problems are stated in terms of units commonly used in the semiconductor literature. The basic system of units is rationalized MKS, although cm is often used as a convenient unit of length. Similarly, electron volts (eV) are often used rather than joules (J) to measure the energy of electrons. Units for various quantities are given in Appendices I and II. Presentation </p><p> In presenting this material at the undergraduate level, one must anticipate a few instances which call for a phrase such as "It can be shown. . ." This is always disappointing; on the other hand, the alternative is to delay study of solid state devices until the graduate level, where statistical mechanics, quantum theory, and other advanced background can be freely invoked. Such a delay would result in a more elegant treatment of certain subjects, but it would prevent undergraduate students from enjoying the study of some very exciting devices. </p><p> The discussion includes both silicon and compound semiconductors, to reflect the continuing growth in importance for compounds in optoelectronic and high-speed device applications. Topics such as heterojunctions, lattice matching using ternary and quaternary alloys, variation of band gap with alloy composition, and properties of quantum wells add up to the breadth of the discussion. Not to be outdone by the compounds, silicon-based devices have continued their dramatic record of advancement. The discussion of FET structures and Si integrated circuits reflects these advancements. Our objective is not to cover all the latest devices, which can only be done in the journal and conference literature. Instead, we have chosen devices to discuss which are broadly illustrative of important principles. </p><p> The first four chapters of the book provide background on the nature of semiconductors and conduction processes in solids. Included is a brief introduction to quantum concepts (Chapter 2) for those students who do not already have this background from other courses. Chapter 5 describes the p-n junction and some of its applications. Chapters 6 and 7 deal with the principles of transistor operation. Chapter 8 covers optoelectronics and Chapter 9 discusses integrated circuits. Chapters 10 and 11 apply the theory of junctions and conduction processes to microwave and power devices. All of the devices covered are important in today's electronics; furthermore, learning about these devices should be an enjoyable and rewarding experience. We hope this book provides that kind of experience for its readers.

Such is the case with Metcalf?significantly enough, a great-grandson of the author of Moby-Dick?a man now in his 80s living quietly in Massachusetts. Although long admired by poets and by prose experimenters like Guy Davenport and William Gass, Metcalf has been published only in small editions and chapbooks by some very small presses. This first volume in a three-volume effort from Coffee House promises to give a lifetime's innovative work wider exposure and a shot at the posterity it deserves. Metcalf's range of experimentation is vast. "Will West" is a precocious piece documenting the loves and travails of a Cherokee southpaw pitcher who hits the American road. "Genoa" is a spectacular confrontation with Melville's work, the journals of Columbus and molecular biology?all folded into a hallucinatory narrative about two brothers and their different paths through the American century. "Patagoni," "Apalache" and "The Middle Passage" round out the volume, each in its own way breaking new ground. Metcalf has a style all his own, constantly and restlessly renewing itself, utilizing primary source material, poetry, musical notation and straight narrative. His seems a writing career that, perhaps, needed a certain obscurity in order to remain so boldly adventurous, very much in the manner of Melville. Both explorer and archivist, Metcalf maps an invaluable literary landscape, unrestrained by any form or geography. At last, it is open to the general public. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.Who is Paul Metcalf, and why are his collected works being published in three hefty volumes? According to Guy Davenport, who wrote this installment's introduction, Metcalf is an "intensely imaginative" writer. He compares Metcalf's unique collaging of literary styles to the music of Charles Ives, and this comparison extends to Metcalf's subject matter as well as his use of different voices in complex, sometimes dissonant, but always powerfully effective combinations. The great-grandson of Herman Melville and the last of the Black Mountain writers, Metcalf possesses a passionate and dramatic sense of American history. This is particularly evident in <i>Will West</i>, the story of a Native American baseball player, and <i>Genoa</i>, an intriguing tale that embraces several time frames and involves the relationship between two brothers. Metcalf is mercurial, shifting from inner monologues to action and dialogue, from fiction to poetry, history, and extended quotes. He has worked within a deep zone of privacy and artistic integrity. It is now time to make his work available. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Crucial Accountability: Tools for Resolving Violated Expectations, Broken Commitments, and Bad Behavior, Second Edition</h2><p><b>In this UPDATED SECOND EDITION (first edition titled "<i>Crucial Confrontations</i>"), you'll learn how to hold anyone accountable, master performance discussions, and get results.</b><br><br>Behind the problems that routinely plague our organizations and families, you'll find individuals who are either unwilling or unable to deal with broken promises.

But where does it come from and what exactly does it mean? This book examines the origins of psychogeography in the Paris of the 1950s, exploring the theoretical background and its political application in the work of Guy Debord and the Situationists. Psychogeography continues to find retrospective validation in much earlier traditions, from the visionary writing of William Blake and Thomas De Quincey to the rise of the fl�neur and the avant-garde experimentation of the Surrealists. These precursors to psychogeography are discussed here alongside their modern counterparts, for today these ideas hold greater currency than ever through the popularity of writers and filmmakers such as Iain Sinclair, Will Self and Patrick Keiller. From the urban wanderer to the armchair traveller, psychogeography provides us with new ways of experiencing our environment, transforming the familiar streets of our everyday experience into something new and unexpected.

Brooke established his reign over the area, and two further Brooke descendants ruled Sarawak as a British protectorate for the next hundred years until Japanese occupation during World War II followed by cession to Britain. Between the three Rajahs they expanded Sarawak territory, successfully squashed piracy and put in place a structured government and justice system that brought harmony to a diverse multicultural society that had long been in turmoil from clashing cultures, particularly with the widespread practice of headhunting. Published first in 1960 as Sarawak ceded to Malaysia, The White Rajah documents this unique and fascinating time made possible by the &#39;human sympathy, selflessness and a high integrity&#39; of three generations of Brooke men.</p><p>The Sultan of Brunei gave the title of Rajah and sovereignty of Sarawak, a province of Borneo, to James Brooke in 1841.

In an astonishing political career that spanned six decades, this extraordinary statesman lifted Germany out of the ruins of the Second World War and helped shape the modern political landscape, both of his own country and of Europe. <p>Marvelously well written by esteemed biographer Charles Williams, this authoritative portrait captures the complex man who, as West Germany&#x2019;s first chancellor, brought the land of the Rhine out of the devastation wrought by wartime defeat to amazing prosperity and acceptance on the world scene. Difficult yet determined, Adenauer not only instilled his homeland with both economic prosperity and democratic principles, but also succeeded in defusing the tensions between France and Germany that had dominated much of their recent history, paving the way for the Treaty of Rome and the establishment of the European Economic Community.</p> <p>Born in 1876 in Cologne, Adenauer was a devout Roman Catholic who rose from obscurity when he was elected mayor of that city, a position he held for sixteen years. He went on to achieve national prominence in the Weimar Republic but was imprisoned in a concentration camp when the Nazis came to power. Years later, he organized the Christian Democratic Union and became West Germany&#x2019;s first chancellor, retiring after three consecutive reelections in 1963, a few years short of his ninetieth birthday.</p> <p>Williams draws on hitherto untapped sources from the former Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic for this new biography. In this unforgettable life story of one of history&#x2019;s great statesmen, Williams captures the glory, the triumphs, the failures, and the enduring legacy of this exemplary figure.</p> <p>A penetrating epic tale that bears testimony to this most singular of nations, Adenauer is as much about the making of modern Germany as it is about one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s foremost statesmen.</p>Charles Williams, Lord Williams of El-vel, has enjoyed a distinguished political career,becomingaLabour Life Peer in 1985beforebeingelected Deputy Leader of the Opposition in 1989.

But surprisingly, a century ago eugenicists were making the same promises. This book traces the history of the promises of medical genetics and of the medical dimension of eugenics. While mindful of the benefits of genetic medicine, the book also considers social and ethical issues that cast troublesome shadows over these fields.</p><p>Keeping his focus on America, Nathaniel Comfort introduces the community of scientists, physicians, and public health workers who have contributed to the development of medical genetics from the nineteenth century to today. He argues that medical genetics is closely related to eugenics, and indeed that the two cannot be fully understood separately.

Composers of video game music must master an array of specialized skills not taught in the conservatory, including the creation of linear loops, music chunks for horizontal resequencing, and compositional fragments for use within a generative framework. In A Composer's Guide to Game Music, Winifred Phillips&#x2015;herself an award-winning composer of video game music&#x2015;provides a comprehensive, practical guide that leads an aspiring video game composer from acquiring the necessary creative skills to understanding the function of music in games to finding work in the field.Musicians and composers may be drawn to game music composition because the game industry is a multibillion-dollar, employment-generating economic powerhouse, but, Phillips writes, the most important qualification for a musician who wants to become a game music composer is a love of video games. Phillips offers detailed coverage of essential topics, including musicianship and composition experience; immersion; musical themes; music and game genres; workflow; working with a development team; linear music; interactive music, both rendered and generative; audio technology, from mixers and preamps to software; and running a business.A Composer's Guide to Game Music offers indispensable guidance for musicians and composers who want to deploy their creativity in a dynamic and growing industry, protect their musical identities while working in a highly technical field, and create great music within the constraints of a new medium.</p><p>Winifred Phillips is an award-winning composer who has composed the music for such video games as <i>Assassin's Creed Liberation, The Da Vinci Code, God of War, Shrek the Third, Spore Hero</i>, the LittleBigPlanet franchise, and many others.<p>Winifred Phillips's passion and understanding of this medium comes to life on the page and is a direct result of her vast experience and accomplishment in composing for video games.

Throughout history, rhetorical theorists have provided a comprehensive account of how individuals fulfill each of these needs. Current in its theory and practical in its approach, the book encourages readers to apply rhetorical theory to their personal, professional, and civic worlds. Borchers organizes theoretical insights topically rather than chronologically, so readers are better able to track the similarities and differences in central ideas. He provides context for understanding why rhetorical theories have been created, how they relate to the real world, and how they influence and are influenced by other ideas associated with human behavior. His writing style is engaging and not overly technical, serving the needs of readers without a specialized background. Gendered, feminist, and non-Western approaches are integrated throughout the book.

Through an endearing narration by Scott Brick, listeners feel as if they're in the room as Ford speaks candidly to the longtime Washington reporter. Ford opens up about fellow politicians, his post-presidential schedule, his love of his home state of Michigan, and more. The book covers personalities more than policies and is not to be considered a biography, but it touches on many interesting aspects of Ford's life. Brick changes his voice ever so slightly when expressing Ford's words and DeFrank's empathy. In listening, one develops a good sense of their relationship while learning much about the former president.

The focus is on the tools that both practitioners and researchers use in real life. It is intended to be a comprehensive collection of the theory, methods, and applications of regression methods, but it has been deliberately written at an accessible level.</p> <p>The handbook provides a quick and convenient reference or &#x201c;refresher&#x201d; on ideas and methods that are useful for the effective analysis of data and its resulting interpretations. Students can use the book as an introduction to and/or summary of key concepts in regression and related course work (including linear, binary logistic, multinomial logistic, count, and nonlinear regression models). Theory underlying the methodology is presented when it advances conceptual understanding and is always supplemented by hands-on examples.</p> <p>References are supplied for readers wanting more detailed material on the topics discussed in the book. R code and data for all of the analyses described in the book are available via an author-maintained website.<br><br><i>"I enjoyed the presentation of the Handbook, and I would be happy to recommend this nice handy book as a reference to my students. The clarity of the writing and proper choices of examples allows the presentations ofmany statisticalmethods shine. The quality of the examples at the end of each chapter is a strength.

James In 1888 Henry James wrote 'There was the customary novel by Mr Le Fanu for the bedside; the ideal reading in a country house for the hours after midnight'. Madam Crowl's Ghost &amp; Other Stories are tales selected from Le Fanu's stories which mostly appeared in The Dublin University Magazine and other periodicals, and their haunting, sinister qualities still have an enormous appeal for the modern reader. The great M.R. James, who collected and introduces the stories in this book, considered that Le Fanu 'stands absolutely in the first rank as a writer of ghost stories.'</p><p></p><h2>Shakespeare&#39;s Sonnets (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)</h2><p>The classic love poems of William Shakespeare are accompanied by prose summaries and critical notes</p><p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE (1564-1616) wrote 37 plays. <i>King Lear</i> and <i>Macbeth</i> are widely considered his finest and most popular. They are, perhaps, the most frequently produced works on the planet.Since we will never hear tapes of Keats or Shakespeare reading, and several recordings by actors exist (e.g., John Keats: Selected Poems, Blackstone Audio, 1993; Sonnets by William Shakespeare, Recorded Bks., 1990), we must judge these tapes by the actors' performances. In John Keats: Poems, Douglas Dodge modulates his voice beautifully to capture the slightly varied emotions of many poems. This well-edited recording contains Keats's most famous works: "La Belle Dame Sans Merci," "The Eve of St. Agnes," "Ode to a Nightingale," "On a Grecian Urn," along with many lesser-known short poems such as "To Mrs. Reynolds' Cat" that exhibit the poet's more fanciful side. Reading all of Shakespeare's sonnets written between 1593 and 1601, actor Simon Callow conveys the dramatic potential not often recognizable in other recordings. With the exception of a few sonnets addressing the muse, anyone unfamiliar with Shakespeare's works could easily believe these were selected monologs from various plays. Pausing briefly between poems, Callow's tone shifts enough to create new characterizations for every sonnet. Both tapes are recommended for smaller collections and essential for larger ones.<br><i>Rochelle Ratner, formerly Poetry Editor, "Soho Weekly News," New York</i><br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Are You &#34;Normal&#34;?: More Than 100 Questions That Will Test Your Weirdness (National Geographic Kids)</h2><p>Can you rub your belly and pat your head?

It is one of the oldest deciphered writings of significant length in the world. The sixth Babylonian king, Hammurabi, enacted the code, and partial copies exist on a man-sized stone stele and various clay tablets. The Code consists of 282 laws, with scaled punishments, adjusting "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth" (lex talionis) as graded depending on social status, of slave versus free man. Nearly one-half of the Code deals with matters of contract, establishing, for example, the wages to be paid to an ox driver or a surgeon. Other provisions set the terms of a transaction, establishing the liability of a builder for a house that collapses, for example, or property that is damaged while left in the care of another. A third of the code addresses issues concerning household and family relationships such as inheritance, divorce, paternity, and sexual behavior. Only one provision appears to impose obligations on an official; this provision establishes that a judge who reaches an incorrect decision is to be fined and removed from the bench permanently. A few provisions address issues related to military service. Hammurabi ruled for nearly 42 years, c. 1792 to 1750 BC according to the Middle chronology. In the preface to the law, he states, "Anu and Bel called by name me, Hammurabi, the exalted prince, who feared Marduk, the patron god of Babylon (The Human Record, Andrea &amp; Overfield 2005), to bring about the rule in the land." On the stone slab there are 44 columns and 28 paragraphs that contained 282 laws. The laws follow along the rules of 'an eye for an eye'.</p><p>Leonard William King, F.S.A. (8 December 1869 &#x2013; 20 August 1919) was an English archaeologist and Assyriologist educated at Rugby School and King's College in Cambridge. He collected stone inscriptions widely in the Near East, taught Assyrian and Babylonian archaeology at King's College for a number of years, and published a large number of works on these subjects. He is also known for his translations of ancient works such as the Code of Hammurabi. He became the Assistant to the Keeper of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities at the British Museum. Hammurabi (died c. 1750 BC) was the sixth Amorite king of Babylon (that is, of the First Babylonian Dynasty, the Amorite Dynasty) from 1792 BC to 1750 BC middle chronology (1728 BC &#x2013; 1686 BC short chronology). He became the first king of the Babylonian Empire following the abdication of his father, Sin-Muballit, extending Babylon's control over Mesopotamia by winning a series of wars against neighboring kingdoms. Although his empire controlled all of Mesopotamia at the time of his death, his successors were unable to maintain his empire. Hammurabi is known for the set of laws called Hammurabi's Code, one of the first written codes of law in recorded history. These laws were inscribed on stone tablets (stelae) standing over eight feet tall (2.4 meters), of unknown provenance, found in Persia in 1901. Owing to his reputation in modern times as an ancient law-giver, Hammurabi's portrait is in many government buildings throughout the world.</p><h2>Basic Geriatric Nursing (Wold, Basic Geriatric Nursing)</h2><p><p>The bestselling LPN/LVN geriatric nursing textbook,<b> Basic Geriatric Nursing, 5th Edition</b> covers age-appropriate nursing interventions in a variety of health care settings.

The book can also be read as a history of Spanish responses to the decline of empire. At a number of points the author indicates that her study can be understood as a supplement to Joseph Schumpeter&#x2019;s <i>History of Economic Analysis</i> (1954).<br> &nbsp;<br> The chief contribution of this book is a review and summary of the development of economic thinking from the earliest days until about 1740 in one of the most important countries of Europe. Despite, or maybe because, Spain was in decline much of the last two centuries of this period, we are provided, as it were, with a ring-side seat for watching intellectuals come to terms with the forces behind such decline. Some of it, such as inflation, debt-financing, military over-extension, mercantilist protectionism, the preference of elites for their own economic benefit at the expense of the state, and more, will be familiar to readers who are familiar with the economic history of the last hundred years. If the distant mirror of history can help us avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, here is one place to find it.<br> &nbsp;<br> This book is dedicated to the memory of Leonard Liggio (1933&#x2013;2014).</p><p><b>Marjorie Grice-Hutchinson </b>was the author of <i>The School of Salamanca.
